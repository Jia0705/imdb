"Disney's live-action Snow White is finally here, and after watching it, I can confidently say that the Magic Mirror needs a new prescription. This movie is less ""fairest of them all"" and more ""fairest at failing upwards."" If you ever wondered what it would look like if someone took the classic 1937 animated masterpiece, ran it through a corporate buzzword generator, and then tossed in some awkward CGI for good measure-congratulations, you've found your answer!

A Princess with a Personality (Kind Of?)

Rachel Zegler takes on the role of Snow White, though you'd be forgiven for thinking she was actually playing a medieval TED Talk speaker. Instead of the wide-eyed, kind-hearted princess we all knew, this Snow White is a Strong Independent Woman™-because saying ""I want to be a queen, not a bride"" apparently counts as character development these days. That's right, folks, forget charming dwarfs, woodland creatures, or actual chemistry with anyone; this Snow White has dreams, and she's here to remind you about them every five minutes.

But despite all that, her biggest challenge in the movie isn't even the Evil Queen-it's keeping the audience awake.

Gal Gadot: Evil Queen or Instagram Influencer?

Now, let's talk about Gal Gadot's Evil Queen. You'd think that playing a narcissistic, beauty-obsessed villain would be an easy fit for Hollywood, but somehow, even with all the pouting, dress-swishing, and over-the-top glowering, she ends up about as menacing as a fashion blogger with a bad attitude.

Her obsession with being ""the fairest of them all"" is laughable when you realize that, well... she already is the fairest of them all. No offense to Snow White, but if the mirror told me that Gal Gadot wasn't the hottest person in the kingdom, I'd be smashing that thing to pieces too. The real villain here is the mirror's manufacturer.

The Dwarfs: Now with 90% Less Dwarfs!

Ah yes, the seven dwarfs-except, surprise! They're not really dwarfs anymore. Instead, we get a diverse group of CGI-enhanced ""magical creatures"" who look like they were rejected from The Lord of the Rings for being too unsettling. Imagine if a bunch of carnival performers got stuck in a blender with bad CGI, and you've got these guys.

Their role in the movie? Mostly to exist, deliver unfunny one-liners, and make you wonder if we should start a petition to bring back actual actors instead of whatever motion-capture madness this is. If I wanted to spend two hours looking at weirdly animated characters, I'd just play a bad video game.

The Apple Fiasco

We all know the story: Evil Queen poisons apple, Snow White eats apple, Snow White falls into a death nap, and then a prince shows up to wake her with true love's kiss. Simple, right? Nope. Not in this version.

Instead, we get a long, drawn-out scene where Snow White almost eats the apple, but then stops to give another speech about believing in yourself or some nonsense. And when she does finally bite it, the whole moment is ruined by some weird slow-motion effects that make it look like an overly dramatic shampoo commercial.

Honestly, I was rooting for the apple at that point. Maybe if she stayed in an enchanted coma, we'd all be spared another unnecessary Disney remake.

Final Verdict: The Fairest Disaster of Them All

This movie is what happens when you take a beloved classic, strip away everything that made it charming, and replace it with corporate-approved ""modernization"" that pleases no one. It's a film that wants to be empowering, but instead feels like a checklist of forced inclusivity and soulless spectacle.

Snow White (2025) is proof that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone. If you're looking for magic, wonder, and nostalgia, just rewatch the 1937 version.

"As always, whenever there's a negative hype around a movie, my mindset is always, prove them wrong, give it a chance.

It's diabolical, honestly, I can't understand how so much money and so much time has gone into this, the final result is cringe worthy. It is an absolute shocker, I am stumped to find any positives.

It looks and feels so artificial, the sets, the animals, as for The Dwarves themselves, I have no words to express my feelings there.

The biggest catastrophe, not what I was expecting if I'm honest, the worst offender, Gal Gadot, she looks sensational, but her performance, she's going to scoop some unwanted awards it's fair to say.

What I wasn't expecting, was just how poor the costumes would look on screen, Snow White's just doesn't translate very well, the hairstyle, what were they thinking?

"Disney's latest live-action remake, Snow White (2025), is yet another attempt to cash in on nostalgia, but unfortunately, it falls flat in almost every regard. From lackluster performances to subpar CGI, this film struggles to capture the magic of the original classic.

Rachel Zegler: A Miscast Lead

Rachel Zegler, who takes on the iconic role of Snow White, delivers a performance that feels stiff and uninspired. While she undeniably has a strong singing voice, her acting lacks the warmth and charm that made the animated Snow White so beloved. Her line delivery often comes off as forced, and she struggles to bring emotional depth to the character. Instead of exuding the innocence and kindness associated with Snow White, her portrayal feels distant and, at times, even disengaged.

Weak CGI and Bland Visuals

For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar. The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts. The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.

Music: Strong Vocals, Forgettable Songs

If there's one aspect where the film slightly shines, it's Zegler's singing. She undeniably has a beautiful voice, and her vocal performances are solid. However, the new songs she's given are bland and unmemorable, failing to capture the whimsy and timeless appeal of the original soundtrack. Unlike Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, which at least had a few standout musical moments, Snow White's soundtrack feels generic and uninspired.

Conclusion: A Missed Opportunity

Ultimately, Snow White is another soulless live-action remake that lacks the heart and magic of the original. While Zegler's singing is a bright spot, her acting, coupled with bad CGI and uninspired musical numbers, makes this adaptation feel unnecessary. Disney had an opportunity to bring a fresh and captivating take on Snow White, but instead, they delivered a forgettable and lackluster film. Fans of the original will likely leave disappointed, longing for the charm and artistry that made the 1937 classic a masterpiece.",1/10,disney latest remak snow white yet anoth attempt cash nostalgia unfortun fall flat almost everi regard lacklust perform subpar cgi film struggl captur magic origin classic rachel zegler miscast lead rachel zegler take icon role snow white deliv perform feel stiff uninspir undeni strong sing voic act lack warmth charm made anim snow white belov line deliveri often come forc struggl bring emot depth charact instead exud innoc kind associ snow white portray feel distant time even disengag weak cgi bland visual film disney budget cgi shockingli subpar enchant forest felt lush immers look artifici cgi creatur lack express charm anim counterpart controversi awkward unnatur make hard emot invest presenc visual effect snow white feel rush instead enhanc experi serv constant distract music strong vocal forgett song one aspect film slightli shine zegler sing undeni beauti voic vocal perform solid howev new song given bland unmemor fail captur whimsi timeless appeal origin soundtrack unlik beauti beast littl mermaid least standout music moment snow white soundtrack feel gener uninspir conclus miss opportun ultim snow white anoth soulless remak lack heart magic origin zegler sing bright spot act coupl bad cgi uninspir music number make adapt feel unnecessari disney opportun bring fresh captiv take snow white instead deliv forgett lacklust film fan origin like leav disappoint long charm artistri made classic masterpiec,0.8271,0.133,0.103,0.765,Positive
"Saw this at the cinema with my six-year-old daughter. She laughed at a few scenes but whispered, ""this is boring"" about forty five minutes in. Watched the rest but we were both happy when the movie ended.

For me, the CGI was distractingly bad. I wasn't aware of the issues the film had with casting prior to the release but they should have either gone with actual actors or spent more money. It's worse than you think, and it's not just the dwarves, the forest and other scenes are poorly done.

A couple of the songs were catchy but by that point I just wanted the credits to roll. Acting wise, I guess the actors had to work with what they were given, but they seemed disconnected and going through the motions. Snow white's lines sounded forced and uncommitted. A better actor might have played the role more believably but again, she had to work with what she was given. I think though, the original film had an innocence this actress didn't grasp or was unable to portray.

Really, this movie seemed more like a 'direct to video' movie than a large budget Disney production. I've seen better CGI in small budget television shows and far better acting. Maybe miss this one unless your little ones really want to see it. Even then, maybe wait for it to be free on a streaming service. It's just not worth paying to see.",1/10,saw cinema daughter laugh scene whisper bore forti five minut watch rest happi movi end cgi distractingli bad awar issu film cast prior releas either gone actual actor spent money wors think dwarf forest scene poorli done coupl song catchi point want credit roll act wise guess actor work given seem disconnect go motion snow white line sound forc uncommit better actor might play role believ work given think though origin film innoc actress grasp unabl portray realli movi seem like video movi larg budget disney product seen better cgi small budget televis show far better act mayb miss one unless littl one realli want see even mayb wait free stream servic worth pay see,0.9648,0.222,0.062,0.716,Positive
"Snow White remake set out to modernize the classic fairy tale, but it ultimately leaves audiences disappointed. The film fails to stay true to the original story while also struggling to establish its own identity.

First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.

The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.

When it comes to visuals and production quality, the film is shockingly mediocre for a Disney production. The CGI looks cheap, backgrounds feel artificial, and instead of creating a magical atmosphere, the movie ends up looking dull and uninspired.

Ultimately, this film feels like Disney turning its back on its own legacy. It doesn't come across as a loving modernization of a beloved classic but rather a project driven by political correctness with little artistic vision. The result? A failed adaptation that neither satisfies old fans nor captivates new audiences.

Another remake where Disney continues to kill the magic of its classic animations...",1/10,snow white remak set modern classic fairi tale ultim leaf audienc disappoint film fail stay true origin stori also struggl establish ident first foremost lifeless script major issu charact lack depth dialogu feel artifici emot connect audienc key element fairi tale alter rather make stori engag chang strip essenc perform particularli impress either rachel zegler portray snow white lack charisma inspir make charact feel ordinari time even unlik addit charact replac seven dwarf weakli design serv meaning purpos stori come visual product qualiti film shockingli mediocr disney product cgi look cheap background feel artifici instead creat magic atmospher movi end look dull uninspir ultim film feel like disney turn back legaci come across love modern belov classic rather project driven polit correct littl artist vision result fail adapt neither satisfi old fan captiv new audienc anoth remak disney continu kill magic classic anim,-0.8505,0.086,0.141,0.774,Negative
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is yet another misguided attempt to modernize a classic, but instead of breathing new life into the beloved fairy tale, it strips away everything that made the original special. With uninspired performances, weak visuals, and forgettable music, this film serves as a prime example of why not every animated masterpiece needs a live-action remake.

Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm Casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.

Dull Visuals & Poor CGI Disney is known for its stunning animation and groundbreaking CGI, but Snow White (2025) somehow manages to look cheap and unpolished. The enchanted forest, which should have been lush and magical, looks like an over-processed video game backdrop. The CGI dwarfs, which already sparked controversy before release, look awkward and unnatural, making it even harder to connect with them emotionally. Rather than immersing the audience in a fantasy world, the visuals constantly pull you out of the experience.

Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack The one highlight of the film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous live-action adaptations, which at least attempted to reimagine classic melodies, Snow White (2025) fails to create any memorable musical moments. The new songs lack the magic of Someday My Prince Will Come or Heigh-Ho, leaving nothing that audiences will hum after leaving the theater.

Conclusion: Another Failed Remake Snow White (2025) is a textbook example of how not to remake a beloved film. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away its charm and replaces it with a lifeless, forgettable adaptation. Disney had the chance to create something special, but what we got instead is yet another uninspired cash grab that fails to justify its existence. Fans of the original will likely leave the theater disappointed and frustrated, once again questioning why Disney insists on remaking its animated classics when the magic clearly isn't there.

"Putting aside of all the political controversy and discussions revolving around the film, if we focus this remake as itself, still, it is really unnecessary and quite dull.

Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive. Snow White is one of those dull ones. Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial. Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.

The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been.

Despite some good looking designs on the backgrounds and all, it was really boring. Marc Webb tries his best but unfortunately, really little about this would ever work.

"I attended the Snow White remake last Thursday with high hopes, only to find myself marooned in a sea of kitsch, cheap effects, and an utterly barren vision.

Marc Webb's direction could generously be described as a masterclass in mediocrity-an exercise in how not to reimagine a classic. His handling of the material was so devoid of creativity that even the most outlandish camp would have been an improvement.

The so-called seven dwarfs? They weren't authentic actors at all; instead, we were treated to a parade of CGI caricatures that failed to capture any semblance of charm. Their forced musical numbers were as out-of-place as a kazoo in a symphony-an entirely misguided attempt at infusing musical flair that only underscored the film's overall discordance.

Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White was painfully bland, with a performance that vacillated between uninspired and downright wooden. And then there's Gal Gadot as the evil queen-her performance, marred by a haughty arrogance, was as unconvincing as it was theatrically misguided. The chemistry, or lack thereof, among the cast only amplified the film's deficiencies.

Every element-from the poor acting to the mismatched musical attempts-conspired to create an experience that was both artistically bankrupt and humorously tragic. It's astonishing how a project can simultaneously squander a beloved tale and insult the audience's intelligence.

Save your time, money, and sanity; this film is a stark reminder that not every retelling deserves a second chance.

"To be fair, I have thought a lot of this movie and found the conclusion that Disney does neither understand the old animated movies nor the original fairy tales.

If you do a twisted fairy tale movie, okay all right, then use a different name, as was done with Frozen or Tangled or ""Mirror, Mirror"" and whatever. Of course, Disney movies are always different, but there is a high responsibility as they are regarded as cultural representation, and as a German, I really want to talk about this controversy. All right, if you need to change the back story of the name Snow White, why not simply introduce a real name. Dwarfs in fairy tales are of course not the same as people with dwarfism, and so the CGI idea with also introducing a human actor with dwarfism (with even a heroic task) could have worked, but removing simply the word dwarf does not help. How odd, as usually Disney is so careful of historical accuracy, there is silence about the obvious German connotations of both 1937 movie and the original tale. Although the love story with a guy called Jonathan is more contemporary elaborated than the insta-meet-cute with her prince, it can not evoke the same emotions as the 1937 movie. CGI animals are cute, but seriously? Snow was already in 1937 a leading lady and strong character, but Walt Disney decided to focus on a decision for love instead of power or ambition, so the political-moral connotations in this new movie are rather more backwarded than they actually are thinking. Although going the safe way with keeping definitely surprisingly many things intact from the 1937 movie, even with an old-fashioned fairy tale book opening and taking something from Cinderella live action - with amazing brightness and cheerfulness, it soon goes away from the old story into a world of reimagining. It makes me think of ""Mirror, Mirror"" with touch of the Disney Robin Hood and Tangled movies (and a bit of the German Simsala Grimm Schneewittchen version!), yet failing to showcase the kindness Snowy is constantly talking about. There could have made better use of the original tales (Brothers Grimm, but also tradition of Ludwig Bechstein, Johann Musäus and Ludwig Albert Grimm). Never much exploring the original characters, but somehow throwing in Jonathan's seven bandits as MIRRORED version to the dwarfs (these were the first version leaked, which turns out not to be the 7 ""dwarfs"",which is a good attempt to keep up a mirror structure of the main Disney couple), but so random named (Bingley?? Norwich??? Why???). Anyway, the music is charming, but reminds with ""let go, let glow"" too much of you know what I mean, also such like a reminiscence ""Waiting on a Miracle"" from Encanto. The spectacular musical scenes are very good, but a big contrast to the quiet cottage-core feeling of the 1937 movie In fact, it's a twisted remix, just like a rock/pop version of a music piece by Mozart. It might be worth as an idea offering enjoyable moments and tunes, but considering it as improvement is insane. Just like Enchanted was already a reimagining of Snow White, this is also another one and should be called in my opinion perhaps ""Mirrored"". An interesting advertisement campaign for the old movie and related products through reverse psychology. Particularly, too many mixed ideas. ""Strong independent"" - but princess -, still not as daring as in Mirror, Mirror, here in a child costume advertisement spot, and let's not forget that girl empowerment does not work this way with an anachronistic understanding of monarchy (Disney Queen franchise?), and let us simply dream, not be lessoned...",1/10,fair thought lot movi found conclus disney neither understand old anim movi origin fairi tale twist fairi tale movi okay right use differ name done frozen tangl mirror mirror whatev cours disney movi alway differ high respons regard cultur represent german realli want talk controversi right need chang back stori name snow white simpli introduc real name dwarf fairi tale cours peopl dwarfism cgi idea also introduc human actor dwarfism even heroic task could work remov simpli word dwarf help odd usual disney care histor accuraci silenc obviou german connot movi origin tale although love stori guy call jonathan contemporari elabor princ evok emot movi cgi anim cute serious snow alreadi lead ladi strong charact walt disney decid focu decis love instead power ambit connot new movi rather backward actual think although go safe way keep definit surprisingli mani thing intact movi even fairi tale book open take someth cinderella live action amaz bright cheer soon go away old stori world reimagin make think mirror mirror touch disney robin hood tangl movi bit german simsala grimm schneewittchen version yet fail showcas kind snowi constantli talk could made better use origin tale brother grimm also tradit ludwig bechstein johann musäu ludwig albert grimm never much explor origin charact somehow throw jonathan seven bandit mirror version dwarf first version leak turn dwarf good attempt keep mirror structur main disney coupl random name bingley norwich anyway music charm remind let go let glow much know mean also like reminisc wait miracl encanto spectacular music scene good big contrast quiet feel movi fact twist remix like version music piec mozart might worth idea offer enjoy moment tune consid improv insan like enchant alreadi reimagin snow white also anoth one call opinion perhap mirror interest advertis campaign old movi relat product revers psycholog particularli mani mix idea strong independ princess still dare mirror mirror child costum advertis spot let forget girl empower work way anachronist understand monarchi disney queen franchis let u simpli dream lesson,0.9959,0.198,0.03,0.772,Positive

"The remake of Snow White is far from living up to its beloved origins. The film fails to capture the charm and magic of the original, and its modern reinterpretation leaves much to be desired. The acting performances are lackluster and unconvincing, with the cast struggling to truly inhabit their roles.

Similarly, the singing-a cornerstone of any classic Disney production-falls flat, delivering numbers that are both technically weak and emotionally uninspired.

This review is not about political correctness or the current trend of being ""woke."" Instead, it's about a missed opportunity to honor a timeless tale. Disney had the chance to recapture the nostalgic essence that made the original so cherished but instead opted for a misguided reinvention that erases much of the magic and wonder we once knew. The story, characters, and musical numbers suffer from a lack of creative vision, resulting in a product that is both disappointing and disheartening.

Ultimately, the Snow White remake is not worth the entry price, as it fails to evoke the emotional resonance and excitement that audiences expect from a Disney classic. It's a stark reminder that sometimes, in the pursuit of modernity, the heart of the story is lost in translation.",1/10,remak snow white far live belov origin film fail captur charm magic origin modern reinterpret leaf much desir act perform lacklust unconvinc cast struggl truli inhabit role similarli cornerston classic disney flat deliv number technic weak emot uninspir review polit correct current trend woke instead miss opportun honor timeless tale disney chanc recaptur nostalg essenc made origin cherish instead opt misguid reinvent eras much magic wonder knew stori charact music number suffer lack creativ vision result product disappoint dishearten ultim snow white remak worth entri price fail evok emot reson excit audienc expect disney classic stark remind sometim pursuit modern heart stori lost translat,-0.9062,0.117,0.197,0.686,Negative
"This movie makes no sense. It is a complete disaster. My 5-year-old was so upset because the cartoons she watched did not look the same in the film. Disney did not work on the script, horrible actor selection and extremely poor CGI. This movie has everything wrong with modern cinema.

"Snow White, the original animated film, was incredibly popular and was responsible for a much needed morale boost during a dark time in the US and the globe.

The remake is not a credit to the original, in many ways it makes a mockery of the original, taking the beloved character and shifting her entirely into someone else.

The music was halfhearted and the dwarves felt like an afterthought, the plot doesn't really involve them beyond their presence, you can tell that many retakes occurred and that fact should be invisible to the audience.

"The original was made almost 90 years ago and sadly you'd think that period of time would mean significant improvements in the ability to make a good movie while there's lots of shiny CGI it just doesn't gel. Disney seem to be on a roll, they bought the Star Wars & Marvel franchises a few years ago and those have been on a steady decline ever since. Unfortunately, the only thing this live action remake looks set to beat is the very low IMDB rating of the 2022 Pinocchio live action remake which has a rating of just 5/10, even with the star power of Tom Hanks, Snow White is sitting at 2 at the moment.

"If you ever wondered how a timeless fairy tale could be transmogrified into a cinematic trainwreck, ""Snow White (2025)"" answers that question in the most excruciatingly painful way possible. This live-action disaster-directed by Marc Webb-manages to twist a magical classic into a hollow parody that insults its own source material.

From the first frame to the final cringe-worthy scene, nothing about this film feels authentic or magical. Rachel Zegler's Snow White, instead of exuding grace or wonder, stumbles through a muddled script that seems more intent on pandering to modern gimmicks than honoring a beloved tale. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, though a familiar face, appears trapped in an identity crisis that renders her both over-the-top and underwhelming. The production's relentless overuse of flashy effects and forced modern sensibilities transforms what should have been a timeless narrative into a disjointed mess-an exercise in creative misdirection that leaves audiences wondering if the director was aiming for satire or if he was simply out of ideas.

The film doesn't just miss the mark-it shatters it into a million unwatchable pieces. It's an utter waste of time and talent, a cinematic abomination that makes you question why any remake was even attempted. Simply put, ""Snow White (2025)"" is a parody of its own potential, a laughable, lifeless rehash that deserves nothing more than a 1/10.

"A Catastrophe of Epic Proportions - A Career-Low for Everyone Involved

Where do I even begin? This movie is not just bad-it's a cinematic trainwreck that should be studied in film schools as a cautionary tale. Every aspect of this film, from the acting to the script to the direction, feels like a masterclass in how not to make a movie.

Let's start with Gal Gadot. Her line delivery is wooden, her expressions range from mildly confused to completely indifferent, and any attempt at emotion falls flat.

The script is an absolute disaster-full of nonsensical dialogue, forced exposition, and laughable attempts at drama. It's as if the writers Googled how to write a screenplay and then actively ignored every good piece of advice. The pacing is absolutely torturous. Scenes drag on for what feels like hours, yet nothing of importance happens. It's both boring and exhausting, which is a rare and unfortunate combination.

And then there's the direction. The action, if you can call it that, is a jittery mess, with rapid cuts that make even the simplest sequences unwatchable. The cinematography is uninspired, and the tone is all over the place-at times trying to be serious, then suddenly switching to unintentional comedy.

The final nail in the coffin is the sheer lack of originality. Every trope, every cliché, every overused plot device is thrown into the mix with no attempt at innovation. It's as if this movie was made by an AI trained exclusively on the worst action scripts ever written.

Simply put, this film is an insult to audiences. It's not just a bad movie-it's an unwatchable disaster. Save your time, your money, and your sanity. Avoid at all costs.

"Disney DNA was originality, innovative artistry, emotional storytelling, attention to detail, timeless appeal and a sense of wonder. These remakes all fail on every aspect.

Originality: (It's a remake after all)


Innovative artistry: There is no innovative tech, or anything that pushes movie making forward.


Emotional storytelling: While the singing is good enough to make you feel chills, in terms of story it just doesn't lands and feels emotionally flat. Maybe, grumpy amd sleepy get close to making you feel something, but it gets easily overshadow.






Sense of wonder: No imagination, you don't feel like you are exploring something you haven't seen before, it doesn't spark that childlike curiosity and awe about things that aren't real, but could be plausible.

Disney DNA died in the 90s. Ever since then they have been culturally and creatively bankrupt, and only survived thanks to all the acquisitions of far more creative and imaginative studios which they gradually are turning to trash.

The original snow white is still remembered almost a century later whereas the new one will be forgotten a year from now.

"Disney's 2025 Snow White isn't just a misstep-it's a full-blown tumble down a creative cliff. In a clumsy attempt to ""modernize"" the classic, the film strips away the magic, charm, and heart that made the original a timeless masterpiece.

Rachel Zegler's performance, while technically competent, feels emotionally disconnected. Her Snow White comes off less like a dreamer and more like someone begrudgingly enduring a role she doesn't believe in. It's hard to root for a character who seems to roll her eyes at the very story she's part of.

The dwarfs-sorry, the ""mystical forest dwellers""-are barely distinguishable, both in personality and purpose. What was once a band of lovable, quirky companions is now a generic group of background extras with less chemistry than a high school science lab.

And then there's the writing. Bland, preachy, and painfully self-aware, the script is so focused on making statements that it forgets to tell a story. The dialogue feels like it was churned out by a committee more interested in Twitter applause than timeless storytelling.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. Sure, there are some beautiful shots, but they're buried under flat CGI environments that feel more like a theme park ride than an enchanted forest.

Ultimately, this Snow White is less a reimagining and more a joyless rebranding. In its eagerness to prove it's not ""that old fairy tale,"" it forgets to be a fairy tale at all.

"Disney's live-action Snow White aims to reimagine a timeless fairy tale, yet it falters dramatically due to Gal Gadot's uninspired portrayal of the Evil Queen. Gadot's performance is marked by an overdone, mechanical display of villainy-her exaggerated eyebrow arch and flat vocal delivery fail to capture any real menace or seductive complexity. One respected critic from DiscussingFilm even claimed this might be Gadot's worst performance to date. Rather than delivering a multifaceted, memorable antagonist, Gadot's Queen comes off as a poorly conceived caricature that drains the film of dramatic tension.

"The 2025 remake of Snow White is, quite frankly, a disaster in every sense. What was once a timeless fairy tale full of heart and wonder has been stripped down to a dull, lifeless spectacle with none of the charm or magic that made the original so beloved.

The acting is flat and uninspired, with performances that feel forced and emotionally disconnected. The lead actress, in particular, struggles to bring any real presence or depth to the iconic role of Snow White, leaving the character feeling hollow and unrelatable.

Visually, the film fares no better. The animation and effects are shockingly subpar - at times reminiscent of outdated video game graphics. Rather than enchanting the audience, the film bombards them with artificial visuals that lack any real artistic vision.

But perhaps the greatest failure lies in the story itself. The narrative is scattered, lifeless, and entirely devoid of emotional resonance. Gone is the heart of the original tale, replaced by a rushed, soulless plot that seems more interested in ticking boxes than telling a meaningful story.

"It's honestly quite eye-rolling how people have ganged up on this movie. It's clear they have nothing better to do than to try to bring people down. I'd hate to live my life like that. Especially considering this movie turns out to be one of the most innocent features to come out in a while.

I went into Snow White without any devoted dedication to the original. For the first ever full-length animated feature, it has some good expressions, refreshingly organic animation, good colours and decent slapstick. It's also kind of slow-paced in my opinion, and I find it more enchanting as a piece of history than something I'll want to revisit. This movie on the other hand...

I knew they were trying a few new things with this one, and I was more interested in what those would be than honouring the original. And I have to say this new but still familiar take on the classic story was a feast on the eyes and especially the ears.

This is more of a Frozen-style musical, which is a hit-or-miss genre for me, but turns out, the songs, especially the new songs, are delightful. There are a few times where I felt they could've shaved off one or two, or not paused before the end. But every song was toe-tapping, and got better the more they went along. My favourites had to be Waiting on a Wish, Good Things Grow, and Hand Meets A Hand. I'm generally not a fan of musicals with too much music, because sometimes I feel there are moments that are better spoken than sung. This is no exception. But every moment where I felt that, I have to admit, the song was still decent. They don't get rid of the songs from the original, but the completely new songs were my favourites.

The dwarfs were a bit off-putting at first, but that's primarily because I'm so used to seeing them in cartoon form after all these years, whether from the original movie or in promos. But the truth is, if they were more similar to their original designs, they probably would've seemed plastic. And as the movie went on, I got used to them. Dopey took a fair minute, but I grew to like each of their designs.

And Rachel Zegler is incredible. I became a fan of hers after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and I knew from that film she was going to be an amazing Snow White and she did not disappoint. Her singing, her soul, her completely natural and sincere performance...she's always been an amazing actress, and since this is her most popular project yet, I hope people really see it for what it is and give her the praise she deserves.

Snow White's two main messages are simple; united we stand, divided we fall. And rulers who hoard wealth and create division are evil. Oh, and that a bit of kindness goes a long way. Sometimes it's very on-the-nose. And it could've gone further in those messages. But in the end...those things are there, and they are the truth. What this movie is is a simple display of these messages, but in a world where we're encouraged to hate one another so much, it's nice to see a movie proud to promote inclusivity and togetherness, and how those values make you a true leader for the people. Kids will enjoy the messages, but adults may be reminded of how these things they were probably taught when they were kids...maybe they need a reminder of them? Like To Kill A Mockingbird, the movie reminds us that sometimes adults forget themselves and lose their innocence. And maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to try and reclaim it.

This live-action remake honours the original that started animation as we know it, and extends the world with a more involving story, some new terrific songs, and a superb lead actress carrying it all. It's not perfect but it's honourable. Like the 2007 Hairspray, I finished the movie with my feet tapping. I'm looking forward to watching it again.

"This movie was horrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Get it together, Disney. I am baffled by how a corporation like Disney manages to screw up a classic.

It is clear that if Disney continues to go against the original concept, it will be an epic failure. Stick to the original. It is a classic for a reason. There was no need to revamp anything. I do not understand the need or desire to change things.

"Just watched Snow White and yeah, I wasn't a fan. I went in curious to see how they'd reimagine the classic, but it kind of missed the mark for me. First off, it didn't feel like Snow White at all. They tried really hard to make it modern and ""different,"" but in doing that, they stripped away everything that made the original story charming and magical. It felt more like they were pushing a message than telling a fairy tale. Not saying stories can't evolve, but this one felt forced.

Rachel Zegler's version of Snow White wasn't relatable or likeable. She came off a bit self-important instead of kind and warm like the Snow White we all know. And where are the dwarfs? They swapped them out for random magical creatures, and it just didn't have the same fun vibe. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen was probably the best part-she had some great moments-but even she couldn't save it.

Visually, it was okay. Some scenes looked cool, but overall it was super CGI-heavy and kind of flat. The songs? Pretty forgettable, honestly. Nothing I'd go back and listen to. Overall, it felt like they tried so hard to make a statement that they forgot to make a good movie.

I don't understand the CGI choices. There are plenty of actors who could have played the Dwarfs. It made it weird that they were CGI and I didn't connect with them at all.

Rachel's acting was decent, but most of the rest were terrible. Gal Gadot being the worst. The overacted and it just came off as cheesy and stale instead of a fresh take on the evil queen.

"Without spoilers: The movie is poorly cast and has weak character design for nearly all characters. It's not to say any actor(s) in particular are bad at acting, no, its that certain ones were honestly just bad choices because they do not fit the character they were playing. Additionally, very amateur costume design and makeup accross the board, especially for the main character. They could have made a much more beautiful dress while keeping it like the original and given her much better hair and makeup. It looked cheap, like a costume, as did other characters outfits.

"As someone who appreciates both classic Disney films and fresh reimaginings, I went into Snow White (2025) with an open mind. Unfortunately, what I got was a bland, uninspired adaptation that lacks the charm, heart, and magic of the original.

The biggest issue is the writing. The film strips away the fairy-tale wonder and replaces it with generic, uninspired storytelling. The dialogue feels forced, the emotional beats fall flat, and the pacing drags. Instead of enhancing the story, the changes to the original plot feel unnecessary, as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to make a statement rather than tell a good story.

The casting is another letdown. While there was potential, the performances feel wooden and lack chemistry. Snow White, a character who should embody kindness and wonder, comes across as oddly lifeless, and the supporting cast doesn't fare much better. The reimagined seven companions, in particular, feel out of place and lack the personality that made the dwarfs so memorable.

Visually, the movie has moments of beauty, but it's inconsistent. Some CGI-heavy sequences look rushed and artificial, breaking the immersion. The costume and set design, while ambitious, don't always fit the tone of the story, making it feel more like a generic fantasy film than a distinct Snow White adaptation.

Perhaps most disappointing is the lack of a strong musical presence. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is beloved in large part due to its iconic songs, but the new film's soundtrack is forgettable. Any attempts to modernize the music fall flat, making it feel soulless rather than enchanting.

Overall, Snow White (2025) is a missed opportunity. It fails to capture the magic of the classic while offering nothing compelling in return. Instead of a fresh and exciting reimagining, we're left with a hollow, uninspired film that will likely be forgotten soon after the credits roll.

"Snow White is not a bad movie. It is hardly a masterpiece either. The movie, although beautifully made, lacks the gentle beauty of the classic 1937 animation. The good intentions in making this movie and the goal to modernize it for younger audiences can be well seen, but was it really necessary?

From a song in which Snow White actually gives consent to the ""prince"" character prior to her eating the poison apple, to poor character development, inclusion of pointless characters and toning down of the Evil Queen's scary and devilish looming presence, the movie seems to be a patchwork quilt of some politically correct behavior, a not very deep story (although it tries to be), characters we know and love and some new ones we're introduced to and don't really get to know (and never do).

Rachel Zeggler both acts and sings beautifully and her theme song is a show stopper. Her vocals I dare say are clearer than Halle's Part of Your World. Now, Gal Gadot (oh boy) plays a flowy and way too over the top Evil Queen, that unfortunately is but a far dying echo of the Evil Queen in the animation.

Production problems and reshoots can be clearly seen when Snow White's hair distractingly changes both length and style, sometimes in the very same music sequence.

Speaking of music sequence, the Evil Queen absolutely did not need songs of her own, what breaks her character and makes us lose credibility in her evilness. She just feels...goofy.

I personally also felt a slight little political theme here and there, but that might just be me.

That being said, again the movie is not bad. It's CUTE and endearing but a little stale, like a cookie that's not very well baked, but it still ok. The visuals and CGI are stunning and, yes, I can see some uncanny valley happening with the dwarfes but nothing distracting or creepy at all. They look amazing nonetheless and the details are jaw dropping (Dopey was actually my favorite character in the movie).

"I don't even know where to begin with this utter disaster. From the first frame to the last, this movie is an insult to anyone who values cinema. The plot is a nonsensical jumble of ideas that not only fail to make sense but also seem completely random. It's as if the writers threw every trope into a blender, hoping that something would stick. Spoiler: Nothing does.

The acting was atrocious-if you can even call it that. The lead actor looked like they'd rather be anywhere else, delivering every line with the energy of a wet cardboard box. It was like watching someone who had no interest in the role try to read a script they barely understood. The supporting cast? Even worse. Their performances were so bad I was genuinely embarrassed for them. If this was a high school drama club production, I'd still be appalled.

The dialogue is so cringe-worthy that I almost wanted to walk out of the theater. The characters spoke like they were reading off a sheet of paper, with no chemistry or emotion between them. Any attempt at humor fell completely flat, and every ""dramatic"" moment was laughably contrived. It was as if the filmmakers thought slapping together some words would somehow create a compelling story.

Visually, it's a nightmare. The special effects are so poorly done that they look like they came from a low-budget student film. The cinematography was as uninspired as it gets-every shot felt lazy, like they were in a rush to get it over with. Not a single scene felt well thought out or purposeful. And the soundtrack? Forgettable, uninspired, and completely out of place.

The pacing was a torture. This film was way too long for the amount of nothing it offered. Scenes dragged on endlessly, and I found myself begging for it to end. By the time the credits finally rolled, I felt like I had just wasted hours of my life.

Rachel Zegler delivers a good performance, bringing some charm and depth to the character, yet the overall story feels disjointed and lacks the emotional weight of the original. The decision to use CGI dwarfs instead of practical effects or real actors is disappointing, as it removes much of the warmth and personality that made them so memorable.

"Disney's latest attempt to reimagine a beloved classic, Snow White (2025), is nothing short of a catastrophe. Stripping away the heart and soul that made the original a timeless masterpiece, this misguided remake fails to add anything meaningful to the legacy of Walt Disney's work. One can only imagine Walt Disney rolling in his grave at the sight of this soulless adaptation.

Rachel Zegler, portraying Snow White, delivers a performance that lacks warmth and charm-traits that are quintessential to the character. Her portrayal feels distant, disinterested, and forced, with her line delivery devoid of genuine emotion. As a result, the emotional connection between the audience and the protagonist is completely absent, making it hard to root for or even care about Snow White's journey.

The visuals, however, are the sole bright spot in this otherwise dismal production. The efforts of the VFX and CGI teams shine through, demonstrating remarkable skill and attention to detail. It's evident that this aspect of the film received genuine care and hard work from the VFX team, but unfortunately, it cannot carry the weight of an uninspired story and lackluster performances. I do think it would have been better if humans played the dwarves though, since there's a lot of them wanting work in Hollywood.

The soundtrack is equally disappointing, with new songs that fail to capture even a shred of the magic and memorable melodies of the original. Bland, forgettable, and uninspired, the music feels more like a filler than a vital component of the storytelling experience.

One of the most glaring flaws in Snow White (2025) lies in its complete disregard for the original story that made the classic an enduring piece of cinematic history. The charm and simplicity of the original fairy tale have been traded for a heavy-handed attempt to modernize the narrative, resulting in a story that feels disconnected and devoid of the timeless magic that Walt Disney so carefully crafted. What made Snow White a beloved tale for generations was its sincerity, innocence, and universal themes, all of which seem to have been discarded in favor of a hollow, surface-level reinterpretation.

Rather than paying homage to the original characters and their arcs, the new story feels like an attempt to reinvent them in ways that are jarring and unfaithful to the source material. This shift not only alienates fans of the original but also undermines the very essence of what made Snow White's journey resonate so deeply. It's as if the creators prioritized ticking boxes for modern trends over respecting the rich legacy of the original fairy tale.

The performances exacerbate the issue further, as it seems the actors themselves lack respect or understanding for the characters they are portraying. Snow White, a character known for her warmth, kindness, and unwavering optimism, is portrayed with a level of detachment that feels entirely out of place in a fairytale setting. The attempt to inject a new personality into the character comes across as disingenuous, further driving a wedge between the audience and the story.

In many moments, it feels as if the actors are trying to reshape their characters into something unrecognizable, rather than embracing the spirit of the roles they were entrusted with. This disconnect contributes to a sense that the cast and creators view the original material not as a treasured classic to build upon, but as an outdated relic to be replaced. The result is a story and set of performances that fail to capture the heart and whimsy of the fairy tale world.

By disregarding the foundational elements of Snow White, the 2025 remake betrays its source material and its audience. What should have been a celebration of one of Walt Disney's most iconic creations instead feels like a disjointed, half-hearted experiment that strips the tale of its soul. Fans who cherished the original for its timeless simplicity and heartfelt storytelling will find themselves deeply disappointed by this hollow rendition.

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) feels like a cash grab-a lifeless, unnecessary remake that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. Fans of the original will undoubtedly find themselves disappointed and questioning Disney's continued reliance on rehashing classic works. If Walt Disney were here to see this, he would undoubtedly be embarrassed by the state of his cherished studio.

"I went into the new Snow White movie hoping for a fresh, modern take on the beloved classic. What I got instead was a lifeless, uninspired mess that completely misses the charm and magic of the original.

First off, the writing is abysmal. The dialogue feels forced, the attempts at humor fall flat, and the changes to the story feel more like an agenda-pushing checklist than an organic adaptation. Snow White herself is completely devoid of personality, and rather than being a kind and courageous heroine, she comes across as smug and unlikable. The Evil Queen, who should be a scene-stealing villain, is reduced to a generic, one-dimensional antagonist.

The visuals don't help either. Despite a massive budget, the CGI looks cheap, the cinematography is dull, and the costumes are uninspired. Even the dwarves-if you can call them that-are completely forgettable. Whatever sense of wonder and whimsy Disney once had is long gone here.

But perhaps the worst part is how soulless the whole thing feels. Rather than honoring the timeless story that has captivated audiences for generations, this version seems embarrassed by its own source material. The filmmakers clearly wanted to ""fix"" Snow White, but in doing so, they drained it of everything that made it special.

Disney has been churning out unnecessary live-action remakes for years, but this one might be the most disappointing yet.

"Let's just cut to the chase-this movie is trash. I don't know what Disney was thinking, but this remake is an insult to the classic Snow White and honestly, to anyone who values good storytelling, acting, or just basic entertainment.

First off, Rachel Zegler as Snow White? Huge mistake. Her performance feels forced, awkward, and honestly, it seems like she doesn't even want to be there. There's no charm, no warmth-just an overwhelming sense that she's reading off a script and waiting for the check to clear. And Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? Yeah, she looks great, but her performance is so over-the-top it's almost cartoonish. She's not menacing-she's just cringe.

And let's talk about the visuals-Disney had a massive budget, and somehow, this movie still looks like it was shot on a green screen with the cheapest CGI imaginable. The dwarfs? Oh wait-there are no dwarfs. Instead, we get a bunch of random, forgettable side characters that add nothing to the story. It's like Disney went out of their way to make sure nothing about this film resembles what people actually liked about Snow White.

The music? Completely unmemorable. You won't be humming any of these new songs because they sound like they were written by AI on a bad day. Meanwhile, they stripped away the iconic songs from the original because, I don't know, Disney just hates joy now?

And let's not forget the story-it's a mess. They tried to ""modernize"" the plot by making Snow White some kind of girlboss warrior princess who doesn't need a prince, but it's so forced and hollow that it just makes the movie boring. It's not empowering, it's just bad writing.

Overall, this movie is a soulless cash grab that no one asked for. It's not fun, it's not magical, and it certainly doesn't justify its existence. Disney needs to stop with these live-action remakes and actually focus on making new, original films instead of ruining their classics.

Of someone who looks like she skipped out of a high school drama club and straight into a leading role. The magic mirror should've just said, ""You're literally Gal Gadot. Why are we even having this conversation?"" Snow White isn't looking for love anymore-she's staging a one-woman revolution. Every line sounds like she's two seconds away from unionizing the forest creatures. Meanwhile, Prince Charming shows up looking confused, like he wandered in from a different movie... and honestly? By the end, I kinda felt bad for the guy. He just wanted to be part of a love story, not get ghosted while the plot went full manifesto. And the dwarfs? Sorry, ""magical forest people."" They look like Lord of the Rings misfits who got kicked out of Middle-earth and had to settle for a bargain bin CGI. Which, by the way, looks like it was last updated when dial-up internet was still a thing. By the end, I wasn't rooting for anyone except maybe the poison apple.

"Disney's live-action Snow White is not just bad-it's an insult to the original classic. From the moment the film starts, it becomes painfully clear that this remake has no heart, no soul, and no reason to exist beyond squeezing money out of nostalgia.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is one of the biggest disappointments. Rather than exuding menace or charm, she delivers a bland, lifeless performance that feels more like a last-minute casting decision than a carefully chosen role. Her lack of depth makes the Queen more laughable than intimidating, turning an iconic villain into a forgettable mess.

The worst part? The film's attempt to ""modernize"" the story comes off as painfully forced and preachy. Instead of adding depth, it strips away the whimsy and wonder that made Snow White a beloved fairytale in the first place. The story drags through dull, uninspired dialogue, and any attempt at emotional weight feels hollow.

Visually, the film is another disaster. The excessive CGI looks cheap and artificial, making everything feel more like a second-rate video game than a big-budget Disney production. Instead of immersing the audience in a magical world, it actively pulls them out of the experience with lifeless backdrops and characters that feel oddly disconnected from their surroundings.

Disney had the opportunity to reimagine Snow White in a way that honored the original while bringing something new to the table. Instead, they delivered a soulless, joyless, and utterly forgettable film that nobody asked for.",1/10,disney snow white insult origin classic moment film start becom pain clear remak heart soul reason exist beyond squeez money nostalgia gal gadot portray evil queen one biggest disappoint rather exud menac charm deliv bland lifeless perform feel like cast decis care chosen role lack depth make queen laughabl intimid turn icon villain forgett mess worst part film attempt modern stori come pain forc preachi instead ad depth strip away whimsi wonder made snow white belov fairytal first place stori drag dull uninspir dialogu attempt emot weight feel hollow visual film anoth disast excess cgi look cheap artifici make everyth feel like video game disney product instead immers audienc magic world activ pull experi lifeless backdrop charact feel oddli disconnect surround disney opportun reimagin snow white way honor origin bring someth new tabl instead deliv soulless joyless utterli forgett film nobodi ask,-0.9678,0.094,0.211,0.695,Negative
"The new Snow White movie is a glaring example of how reboots can miss the mark when trying too hard to modernize a classic story. While the film attempts to update the themes and characters for a contemporary audience, it ultimately sacrifices the heart and magic that made the original so beloved.

One of the most glaring issues is the weak writing. The dialogue often feels forced, with characters delivering lines that seem more focused on making a statement than advancing the story naturally. The plot itself is a far cry from the whimsical charm of the original, coming across as overly complicated yet emotionally hollow.

The casting decisions, while bold, fail to deliver. The lead performance lacks the charisma and warmth required to carry the film, making it difficult to connect with the character. Even the supporting cast struggles to shine, with underwhelming portrayals of iconic roles that feel uninspired and forgettable.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some scenes boast impressive production design, others are marred by unconvincing CGI that detracts from the overall experience. The cinematography fails to capture the enchanting, storybook-like quality one would expect from a Snow White adaptation.

Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the lack of emotional resonance. Where the original thrived on themes of love, kindness, and courage, this version feels more like a lifeless attempt to tick off boxes of modern trends rather than a heartfelt retelling.

Overall, the new Snow White feels like a shallow, uninspired attempt to cash in on nostalgia while alienating fans of the original.

"Where do I even begin with the disaster that is the new Snow White movie? Watching it felt less like enjoying a cinematic fairytale and more like enduring a painfully long lecture on how not to adapt a classic. This remake somehow manages to strip away everything that made the original magical and replaces it with a hollow, tone-deaf mess filled with arrogance and incompetence.

Let's talk about the cast - or rather, the lack of any meaningful performances. The lead is woefully miscast, coming across as smug and detached from the character she's supposed to embody. There's an off-putting air of superiority that clashes with the humility and warmth you'd expect from Snow White. Instead of charm and sincerity, we get wooden line delivery and expressions that range from disinterest to condescension. The supporting cast isn't much better, with performances that feel like rushed table reads rather than crafted characters. It's as if the film was more focused on checking boxes than telling a story.

Visually, the film tries hard to be edgy and ""modern,"" but it ends up looking like a low-effort cosplay production. The special effects are inconsistent, and the costume design swings wildly between uninspired and downright bizarre. The original story's timeless themes of kindness, courage, and love are replaced with forced messaging that feels less empowering and more preachy.

In the end, this Snow White is an unfortunate example of how studios can butcher a beloved tale by losing sight of what made it resonate in the first place.

"My wife and I caught Snow White (2025) in theaters this evening. The story follows a princess whose mother dies and whose father remarries. When he leaves for war, her stepmother reveals her true, diabolical nature. She orders Snow White to be killed in the woods, but when Snow White mysteriously disappears, the queen assumes she's dead-until she discovers otherwise and decides to handle things herself.

Directed by Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer), the film stars Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Andrew Burnap (Spare Room), and Tituss Burgess (Dolemite Is My Name).

This was an uneven film-not as bad as some are saying, but far from great. There were aspects I really enjoyed: Gal Gadot delivered a fantastic performance, the costumes were impressive, and the magical elements of the woods and the dwarfs' house were well done. I particularly liked the sequence of Snow White running through the forest.

Unfortunately, the film relies too heavily on CGI, which makes it feel hollow. The dwarfs, aside from Grumpy (who pretty much carried the film), lacked personality. The love interest was a complete misfire-his look and demeanor felt more like a Gap commercial than the rugged, Robin Hood-type character the story needed. The songs were more miss than hit, and while the ending was solid, the film as a whole just left me wanting more.

In conclusion, Snow White isn't a total waste of time, but it's far from the classic it could have been.

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is an absolute disaster, a lifeless, uninspired mess that should have never been made. It strips away everything magical about the original and replaces it with dull performances, awful CGI, and atrocious writing.

Rachel Zegler is a complete miscast. She lacks any warmth or charm, delivering her lines with the enthusiasm of a bored teenager forced to do homework. She doesn't embody Snow White-she looks and sounds like she doesn't even want to be there.

The CGI dwarfs are hideous. Instead of the beloved original characters, we get creepy, soulless abominations that look like they crawled out of a failed video game.

The script is a joke. It takes itself too seriously while also being completely forgettable. There's no heart, no magic-just bland, corporate-approved nonsense.

The visuals? Dull and artificial. The enchanted forest feels like a cheap green-screen set, and the costume design looks like something out of a bad school play.

The only saving grace is Gal Gadot. She's the one bright spot in this disaster, bringing elegance and presence to an otherwise soulless film. She deserved a better movie.

This thing might be Disney's biggest blunder in history, and I don't say that lightly. ""The Black Cauldron"" developed a passionate cult following. ""Home On the Range"" had some good soundtracks and Steve Buscemi. Disney's new remake of their 1930s animated classic just has absolutely no redeeming quality whatsoever, from this new pauper boy character shoehorned in awkwardly to attempt to appease angry fans of the original, to the offensively hideous CGI and derivative musical numbers where Rachel Zegler belches out her hopes and woes and dreams while staring up awkwardly into random space.

The cinematography is bad and aesthetic designs rely far too much on muted colours and digital padding to try and flesh out this rather dreary scenery into something more vibrant and alive. The costumes look absolutely foolish with the exception of Gal Gadot's. I know people keep on holding out hope for Disney, but we're all adults here, and we grew up. We have kids now who want to see new movies. Disney failed to grow up with us, and a new generation of children wants their 90s Disney Renaissance, but let's be honest here - they're not magical. Snow White is the result of nostalgia commodified, the byproduct of a multinational corporation that has given up on caring or never really cared at all. There's not even anything of value added to the story to make it fresh and new, they just took the original animated version's story and inbred it with a tired old warrior princess uprising resistance thing that ""Maleficent"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" have already used. You couldn't even pay me to watch this again, but on the bright side it might finally wake Disney up to the fact that they can't just coast by on nostalgic properties and overpriced theme parks anymore.",1/10,pictur snow white german princess fair kind heart never envis grown adult woman grate southwestern valley girl affect thing might disney biggest blunder histori say lightli black cauldron develop passion cult follow home rang good soundtrack steve buscemi disney new remak anim classic absolut redeem qualiti whatsoev new pauper boy charact shoehorn awkwardli attempt appeas angri fan origin offens hideou cgi deriv music number rachel zegler belch hope woe dream stare awkwardli random space cinematographi bad aesthet design reli far much mute colour digit pad tri flesh rather dreari sceneri someth vibrant aliv costum look absolut foolish except gal gadot know peopl keep hold hope disney adult grew kid want see new movi disney fail grow u new gener child want disney renaiss let honest magic snow white result nostalgia commodifi byproduct multin corpor given care never realli care even anyth valu ad stori make fresh new took origin anim version stori inbr tire old warrior princess upris resist thing malefic alic wonderland alreadi use could even pay watch bright side might final wake disney fact ca coast nostalg properti overpr theme park anymor,0.979,0.201,0.061,0.738,Positive
What a terrible remake of an iconic movie. Why why why Disney?? Gal Gadot looks great but should've known better to jump on board for this with Zeigler. Terrible portrayal of the iconic Snow White. I was reluctant to go see this movie but i wanted to give it a chance despite all the drama surrounding it. I was hopeful and left feeling very disappointed.

"I went into Snow White (2025) with an open mind, determined to ignore the negative hype and give Disney a chance to prove the doubters wrong. What a colossal mistake that was. This movie isn't just bad-it's a diabolical, cringe-inducing catastrophe that makes you wonder how a studio with this much money and history could churn out such an embarrassing pile of garbage. I'm genuinely stumped trying to find a single redeeming quality in this soulless cash grab.

Let's start with the visuals. The sets look like they were ripped from a low-budget video game, the CGI animals are laughably fake, and don't even get me started on the dwarfs. Whatever Disney was trying to pull with them-reimagined or not-it's an abomination. They're awkward, unnatural, and so poorly rendered I felt secondhand embarrassment for everyone involved. The enchanted forest? More like an over-filtered green screen nightmare. This is supposed to be Disney magic? It's a cheap, artificial mess that yanks you out of the story every five seconds.

Then there's Rachel Zegler as Snow White. Look, her singing voice is fine-great, even-but that's where the compliments end. Her acting is a disaster: stiff, forced, and completely devoid of the warmth or innocence that made Snow White iconic. She sleepwalks through the role like she's bored, delivering lines with all the charisma of a cardboard cutout. This isn't a sweet, kindhearted princess-it's a disinterested robot in a poorly styled wig. Speaking of which, what were they thinking with that hairstyle? And the costumes? They look like they were thrown together from a thrift store clearance bin. Snow White's outfit doesn't translate to live-action-it's a garish eyesore that screams ""we stopped trying."" But the real kicker? Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. She looks stunning, sure, but her performance is so atrocious she's practically guaranteed to sweep the Razzies. It's like she's auditioning for a parody instead of taking the role seriously. Every line she delivers is over-the-top in the worst way possible, making the character more laughable than menacing. She's the biggest catastrophe here, hands down.

Now, about the music. Zegler can sing, no doubt, but the new songs are so bland and generic, they might as well be elevator music. There's not a single tune that sticks with you or evokes any emotion. Compared to the timeless classics like ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" or ""Heigh-Ho,"" these new numbers are forgettable noise. Disney, what were you thinking? You had the chance to create something magical, and instead, you gave us this?

In conclusion, Snow White (2025) is a masterclass in how not to remake a classic. It's a lifeless, charm-less adaptation that strips away everything that made the original special. Disney, you've outdone yourself in all the wrong ways. This isn't just a bad movie-it's an insult to the legacy of Snow White and the audience's intelligence.

"This is not Snow White in any way-neither the story, the characters, nor the narrative. It should have just been named ""A Girl and an Evil Queen"".

I struggle to understand why studios drastically alter beloved stories instead of creating something new. A tale that has stood the test of time does so because of its themes, characters, and essence. Changing 80% of what made it a classic begs the question-why even call it the same story? At that point, it's less an adaptation and more a new narrative borrowing a familiar name.

It often seems like a marketing tactic, leveraging nostalgia and a built-in audience while delivering something barely recognizable. If they truly wanted to tell a fresh story, they could simply create one-perhaps ""inspired by"" the original. That way, they could modernize or innovate without alienating fans who love the classic for what it is.

Ironically, such drastic changes often lead to backlash rather than success. Fans feel betrayed, while new audiences may not connect with something that has lost its original magic. A well-crafted original story, even if influenced by an existing one, would likely be received far better than a hollow rewrite of something iconic.",1/10,snow white stori charact narr name girl evil queen struggl understand studio drastic alter belov stori instead creat someth new tale stood test time theme charact essenc chang made classic beg even call stori point less adapt new narr borrow familiar name often seem like market tactic leverag nostalgia audienc deliv someth bare recogniz truli want tell fresh stori could simpli creat inspir origin way could modern innov without alien fan love classic iron drastic chang often lead backlash rather success fan feel betray new audienc may connect someth lost origin magic origin stori even influenc exist one would like receiv far better hollow rewrit someth icon,-0.6114,0.118,0.142,0.74,Negative

"Disney's 2025 live-action adaptation of ""Snow White,"" directed by Marc Webb, offers a fresh take on the classic tale, blending nostalgia with contemporary storytelling. Rachel Zegler shines in the titular role, embodying Snow White's innocence and strength with a captivating performance that breathes new life into the character. Opposite her, Gal Gadot delivers a compelling portrayal of the Evil Queen, exuding a chilling elegance that adds depth to the iconic villain.

The film introduces Andrew Burnap as Jonathan, a new character who serves as Snow White's ally and love interest. Burnap's chemistry with Zegler brings warmth and authenticity to their evolving relationship, providing a modern twist to the traditional narrative. The Seven Dwarfs are reimagined with a blend of voice acting and motion capture, featuring talents like Jeremy Swift (Doc), Tituss Burgess (Bashful), and Andrew Barth Feldman (Dopey), among others. This approach offers a unique visual representation, though it has sparked discussions regarding the use of CGI over practical casting.

Musically, the film balances classic melodies such as ""Whistle While You Work"" with new compositions by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Notably, the duet ""Princess Problems"" between Snow White and Jonathan stands out, reflecting their differing worldviews and adding depth to their characters. Visually, the movie enchants with lush landscapes and intricate set designs that immerse the audience in a fantastical realm.

However, the film is not without its critiques. Some viewers feel that the reliance on CGI for the dwarfs diminishes their charm, and certain modern updates may not resonate with all fans of the original. Despite these points, ""Snow White"" succeeds in delivering a heartfelt and visually stunning experience, honoring the legacy of the original while introducing thoughtful updates for a new generation.

In summary, ""Snow White"" (2025) stands as a testament to Disney's ability to reimagine its classics, offering a film that is both familiar and refreshingly new. With standout performances from Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, it invites audiences to revisit a beloved story through a contemporary lens.",8/10,disney adapt snow white direct marc webb offer fresh take classic tale blend nostalgia contemporari storytel rachel zegler shine titular role embodi snow white innoc strength captiv perform breath new life charact opposit gal gadot deliv compel portray evil queen exud chill eleg add depth icon villain film introduc andrew burnap jonathan new charact serf snow white alli love interest burnap chemistri zegler bring warmth authent evolv relationship provid modern twist tradit narr seven dwarf reimagin blend voic act motion captur featur talent like jeremi swift doc titu burgess bash andrew barth feldman dopey among other approach offer uniqu visual represent though spark discuss regard use cgi practic cast music film balanc classic melodi whistl work new composit benj pasek justin paul notabl duet princess problem snow white jonathan stand reflect differ worldview ad depth charact visual movi enchant lush landscap intric set design immers audienc fantast realm howev film without critiqu viewer feel relianc cgi dwarf diminish charm certain modern updat may reson fan origin despit point snow white succe deliv heartfelt visual stun experi honor legaci origin introduc thought updat new gener summari snow white stand testament disney abil reimagin classic offer film familiar refreshingli new standout perform rachel zegler gal gadot invit audienc revisit belov stori contemporari len,0.9744,0.158,0.044,0.798,Positive

"This remake of the cherished classic is, without a doubt, one of the most disappointing adaptations we've encountered in recent times. While the original tale of Snow White is a beloved story, endearing to both children and adults alike, this version seems heavily skewed towards an adult audience, but not in a favorable manner. It appears to be aimed at adults who harbor a desire to denigrate the original narrative rather than honor it. The essence of the original story, which captivated audiences with its charm and moral lessons, is utterly lost in this iteration. Disney, a studio renowned for crafting magical and timeless tales, seems to have missed the mark significantly with this production. The decision to produce such a film appears baffling, as it lacks the enchantment and whimsy that fans of the original would expect. Instead of evoking nostalgia and admiration, it leaves a sour taste, standing as an affront to the legacy of Snow White. The characters are poorly developed, the plot lacks coherence, and the visual aesthetics fail to capture the ethereal beauty synonymous with its predecessor. Overall, this rendition seems less like a homage and more like a misguided attempt that strays far from what made the original a masterpiece. It's a shame that Disney, with its vast resources and creative expertise, would choose to release a movie that feels more like a parody than a respectful reimagining of such a treasured story.",1/10,remak cherish classic without doubt one disappoint adapt encount recent time origin tale snow white belov stori endear child adult alik version seem heavili skew toward adult audienc favor manner appear aim adult harbor desir denigr origin narr rather honor essenc origin stori captiv audienc charm moral lesson utterli lost iter disney studio renown craft magic timeless tale seem miss mark significantli product decis produc film appear baffl lack enchant whimsi fan origin would expect instead evok nostalgia admir leaf sour tast stand affront legaci snow white charact poorli develop plot lack coher visual aesthet fail captur ether beauti synonym predecessor overal rendit seem less like homag like misguid attempt stray far made origin masterpiec shame disney vast resourc creativ expertis would choos releas movi feel like parodi respect reimagin treasur stori,0.8882,0.175,0.096,0.729,Positive

"Snow White in 2025 is a soulless, uninspired cash grab that insults the intelligence of audiences. This ""reimagining"" of a beloved classic is a grotesque caricature, devoid of charm, artistry, or any semblance of originality.

Rachel Zegler, saddled with a thankless role, delivers a performance as flat as the film itself. Her Snow White is a pale imitation of the vibrant, iconic character we know and love. Gal Gadot, miscast as the Evil Queen, chews scenery with the subtlety of a bulldozer. Her campy villainy is neither frightening nor entertaining, merely laughable.

The CGI is a disaster. The ""dwarfs"" are an uncanny valley nightmare, a grotesque mockery of human beings. The lush, vibrant world of the original is replaced by a sterile, CGI-heavy landscape that feels more like a video game than a fairy tale.

The musical numbers are forgettable, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the pacing is glacial. Snow White is a cinematic abomination that should be avoided at all costs.

This film is a testament to everything that's wrong with Hollywood today: a cynical attempt to capitalize on nostalgia, devoid of creativity or respect for the source material.

"It's good but should be inspired from Snow White not official Snow White.

""Disappointed"" is my word for this movie feels inadequate when describing my reaction to this film. Marketed as a fresh take, ""inspired by"" the classic tale, it quickly revealed itself to be a disappointingly truncated and seemingly rushed rendition of Disney's Snow White. The initial excitement of seeing a familiar story reimagined was swiftly replaced by a sense of melancholic recognition, a realization that this was less a creative inspiration and more a hollow echo of the original. This isn't to say the film was devoid of merit; certain visual elements were striking, and a few performances held promise. However, the overall experience was marred by a pervasive sense of missed opportunity.

The most glaring flaw was the film's jarring pacing. It felt as though crucial scenes were excised, leaving gaping holes in the narrative. Character development, a cornerstone of any compelling story, was sacrificed at the altar of brevity. Moments that should have resonated emotionally fell flat, due to the lack of necessary context and build-up. The relationship between the protagonist and their companions, intended to be a source of warmth and camaraderie, felt superficial and underdeveloped. Similarly, the antagonist's motivations, which could have been explored with nuance and depth, were reduced to a caricature of villainy. The film's insistence on adhering to the basic plot points of the original, while simultaneously rushing through them, resulted in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.

This sense of incompleteness was particularly disheartening considering the rich potential of the Snow White story. The themes of innocence, envy, and transformation are timeless, offering ample room for creative exploration. Yet, this film seemed content to merely skim the surface, failing to delve into the psychological complexities of its characters or the symbolic depth of its narrative. The ""inspired by"" label felt like a deceptive marketing ploy, a way to lure in audiences with the promise of something new, only to deliver a diluted and rushed imitation of a beloved classic.

Would I recommend this film to my friends? Absolutely not. The one-hour runtime, while seemingly efficient, felt like a disservice to the source material. It was a wasted hour, an hour that could have been spent engaging with a film that truly understood the essence of Snow White. Compared to the masterful adaptations of Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin-films that managed to both honor their origins and forge their own distinct identities-this film felt like a pale imitation. Those films understood that taking the original, and adding to it, and making it their own, is the key to a successful movie. This Snow White inspired film, however, falls short. It lacked the heart, the depth, and the creative spark necessary to truly capture the magic of the original tale, leaving a lingering sense of disappointment and a yearning for a more inspired and fulfilling cinematic experience.",1/10,good inspir snow white offici snow white disappoint word movi feel inadequ describ reaction film market fresh take inspir classic tale quickli reveal disappointingli truncat seemingli rush rendit disney snow white initi excit see familiar stori reimagin swiftli replac sens melanchol recognit realiz less creativ inspir hollow echo origin say film devoid merit certain visual element strike perform held promis howev overal experi mar pervas sens miss opportun glare flaw film jar pace felt though crucial scene excis leav gape hole narr charact develop cornerston compel stori sacrif altar breviti moment reson emot fell flat due lack necessari context relationship protagonist companion intend sourc warmth camaraderi felt superfici underdevelop similarli antagonist motiv could explor nuanc depth reduc caricatur villaini film insist adher basic plot point origin simultan rush result disjoint unsatisfi experi sens incomplet particularli dishearten consid rich potenti snow white stori theme innoc envi transform timeless offer ampl room creativ explor yet film seem content mere skim surfac fail delv psycholog complex charact symbol depth narr inspir label felt like decept market ploy way lure audienc promis someth new deliv dilut rush imit belov classic would recommend film friend absolut runtim seemingli effici felt like disservic sourc materi wast hour hour could spent engag film truli understood essenc snow white compar master adapt cinderella beauti beast manag honor origin forg distinct film felt like pale imit film understood take origin ad make key success movi snow white inspir film howev fall short lack heart depth creativ spark necessari truli captur magic origin tale leav linger sens disappoint yearn inspir fulfil cinemat experi,0.9451,0.128,0.075,0.797,Positive

The cinematography individuals were absolutely stunning. In my opinion, oh my gosh, the colours, the vibrancy delighting it all looks amazing, dude.

But overall, it's more less faithful to the original smell white, which now the only problem I have. With the movie is 2 aspects, the 7 dwarfs. I do think that divisional presentation is faithful, but I do feel a bit mixed on the whole idea of using cgi. Instead of actually hiring little people to play The Doors, I know there's a whole backlash of controversy over that involving peat to think it's buts, it is what it is. I also feel like the ending was very anti. Climactic, it just sort of ended. I expected a big battle in the final act of the first original film in 1937. It was quite dark with the 7 dwalls doing what they did. But in this original new movie, the ending while it's really good And it's very fine.

"For all the questionable controversies that the Internet created about this film long before it came out, with the only justifiable one being the more than understandable tiredness of the Disney live action remakes, now that I've seen it I say: what a bunch of fuss for nothing. Yes, there's not much here that deserves acclaim and there are clear problems, although none of them involve the controversies of the Internet, but in the end there is absolutely nothing here that deserves hate or controversy. Out of the Disney remakes so far this is nowhere near being one of the worst, in fact I'd say it's actually one of the best, even though it's not a very close competition in this club. It's a weird case because there's a lot to like here, but unfortunately there are many problems in the mix that prevent it from reaching its full potential, with two of them in particular that are quite substantial. The first is Gal Gadot who unfortunately is very bad in the film and just doesn't match with the rest of the cast, even with her beautiful looks. And the second is the extremely hideous design of the dwarves, which really gets in the way of some of the good scenes with them and I could never get used to it. The rest are just adjustments and improvements that I think would have polished the story better, given it more development and room to marinate properly. But fortunately, what saves the experience from all of this is that even if it never reaches perfection, the changes and messages made in this reimagining are still very interesting, and the main star manages to carry the film on her shoulders.

Rachel Zegler is truly wonderful here, you can see that she gave her body and soul to this role and she is the definition of a true Disney princess in the flesh, with the voice of an angel and charisma exploding on screen. She is probably the best Disney Princess of these new live action versions, not only because of the actress's work itself but because I liked everything they did to reimagine Snow White, a character I never loved. Instead of keeping the character archaic like in the original animated feature, or just changing everything about her, they managed to create an arc for her that maintains all the best qualities and essence of the character from the 1937 film, but still updating her for today. She sees herself as a helpless maiden who is incapable of solving things on her own, but through the course of the story she learns that she is more than capable of being brave and strong just as she is. She can help in a fight without knowing how to fight, she can fall in love with someone and still have her own agency, and she can very well achieve what she wants even though she's just someone who wants to be a good person and not step on others to do so, like the Evil Queen does. Not only do I think this is a great idea that keeps the character true to her origins with a modern twist, but it also sends a very smart and sweet message, especially to young girls who so far seem to be the audience that are enjoying the film the most, and for good reason.

Otherwise, I found the production to be mostly very solid and well cared for. The cinematography is full of vibrant colors which is refreshing compared to the many grey filled remakes we got, very detailed sets and surprisingly excellent CGI work. The kingdom itself is the only area that doesn't impress much, it just looks like another medieval kingdom with nothing that stands out, unlike the forests or the dwarves' house for example. The dwarves themselves, despite their terrible design, have some good moments as characters, especially with what they do to Dopey and the musical number ""Whistle While You Work"" which is the best moment of the film. The songs from the original were updated appropriately I would say, so that they could fit in with the new songs and have their own identity without clashing with their classic melodies. As for the new songs, I really liked ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""A Hand Meets a Hand"", and the musical number along with the melodies of ""All is Fair"" is pretty cool but Gal Gadot's singing unfortunately gets in the way. The rest is serviceable and has some cute moments of choreography or character interaction, but nothing too memorable beyond those I mentioned. And finally, I liked the change made to the prince, who here is a very different character and Andrew Burnap is charming in the role, but the group of bandits that accompanies him have little to do and could have easily been removed from the film.

In the end, despite my fears going into it, I enjoyed this new version of ""Snow White"", even if there is a lot in it that holds it back from being truly special. It's the kind of film that I want to give a higher score for the things I really liked about it, from the good messages to the excellent work of Zegler or the beautiful visuals. But it's undeniable that it is a turbulent experience with a lot of ups and downs. If you can forgive its missteps enough, there's plenty in here that I think is worth checking out, but I can understand those who could not get past them and end up not liking it. But considering the very low expectations I had, the fact that I got some positive and memorable stuff out of it already makes me quite happy, because there are valuable qualities in it that I really appreciated. I can totally see an audience for it that will really enjoy the experience, and despite having many reservations to make, I will certainly be more on the positive side. At least this remake tries to create something fresh without sacrificing everything from the original with some success, and even though it's not free from some of the old issues that all these remakes suffer from, it still manages to have more merits than many of them. I'll happily take more of this then another ""Lion King (2019)"" thank you very much.",6/10,question controversi internet creat film long came justifi one understand tired disney live action remak seen say bunch fuss noth ye much deserv acclaim clear problem although none involv controversi internet end absolut noth deserv hate controversi disney remak far nowher near one worst fact say actual one best even though close competit club weird case lot like unfortun mani problem mix prevent reach full potenti two particular quit substanti first gal gadot unfortun bad film match rest cast even beauti look second extrem hideou design dwarf realli get way good scene could never get use rest adjust improv think would polish stori better given develop room marin properli fortun save experi even never reach perfect chang messag made reimagin still interest main star manag carri film shoulder rachel zegler truli wonder see gave bodi soul role definit true disney princess flesh voic angel charisma explod screen probabl best disney princess new live action version actress work like everyth reimagin snow white charact never love instead keep charact archaic like origin anim featur chang everyth manag creat arc maintain best qualiti essenc charact film still updat today see helpless maiden incap solv thing cours stori learn capabl brave strong help fight without know fight fall love someon still agenc well achiev want even though someon want good person step other like evil queen think great idea keep charact true origin modern twist also send smart sweet messag especi young girl far seem audienc enjoy film good reason otherwis found product mostli solid well care cinematographi full vibrant color refresh compar mani grey fill remak got detail set surprisingli excel cgi work kingdom area impress much look like anoth mediev kingdom noth stand unlik forest dwarf hous exampl dwarf despit terribl design good moment charact especi dopey music number whistl work best moment film song origin updat appropri would say could fit new song ident without clash classic melodi new song realli like wait wish hand meet hand music number along melodi fair pretti cool gal gadot sing unfortun get way rest servic cute moment choreographi charact interact noth memor beyond mention final like chang made princ differ charact andrew burnap charm role group bandit accompani littl could easili remov film end despit fear go enjoy new version snow white even lot hold back truli special kind film want give higher score thing realli like good messag excel work zegler beauti visual undeni turbul experi lot up down forgiv misstep enough plenti think worth check understand could get past end like consid low expect fact got posit memor stuff alreadi make quit happi valuabl qualiti realli appreci total see audienc realli enjoy experi despit mani reserv make certainli posit side least remak tri creat someth fresh without sacrif everyth origin success even though free old issu remak suffer still manag merit mani happili take anoth lion king thank much,0.9987,0.283,0.084,0.633,Positive

"This live action remake of Snow White is nothing like the original Snow White movie, they put a bunch of new songs in there that sucked and they even changed most of the lyrics to the original songs. The plot was different in many ways and there is no prince Florian, just a bandit named Jonathan. Both actresses were terrible in this movie and I even like Gal Gadot but it was a very poor casting decision. It felt like the movie unnecessarily dragged on halfway through and the ending was awful.

"Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a cinematic catastrophe that fails on every level. This soulless, cringeworthy abomination is a travesty that insults the very concept of storytelling. With a 1/10 rating from critics and audiences alike, it's clear that this movie is a complete and utter disaster.

The first issue is the script, which is a jumbled mess of clichés and poorly written dialogue. The characters are paper-thin, with Snow White herself being a blank slate with no discernible personality. The Seven Dwarfs are reduced to mere caricatures, with no depth or development. The villain, the Evil Queen, is a one-dimensional caricature with no motivation or backstory.

The acting is equally atrocious, with Rachel Zegler struggling to convey any sense of emotion or charisma. Her Snow White is a wooden, unengaging presence on screen, with all the charm and warmth of a damp sock. The supporting cast fares no better, with the usually reliable Gal Gadot and Ben Kingsley phoning in their performances.

The direction is equally uninspired, with Chris Buck and Marc Webb failing to bring any sense of wonder or magic to the proceedings. The action scenes are dull and uninspired, with the special effects looking like they were ripped straight from a video game. The music is forgettable and unmemorable, with none of the iconic songs from the original Disney classic making an appearance.

But perhaps the biggest problem with Snow White is its complete lack of originality. The story is a lazy retread of the original fairy tale, with no new twists or surprises to speak of. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, with the jokes feeling forced and unnatural. The pacing is slow and plodding, with long stretches of boring exposition that fail to engage.",1/10,rachel zegler snow white cinemat catastroph fail everi level soulless cringeworthi abomin travesti insult concept storytel rate critic audienc alik clear movi complet utter disast first issu script jumbl mess cliché poorli written dialogu charact snow white blank slate discern person seven dwarf reduc mere caricatur depth develop villain evil queen caricatur motiv backstori act equal atroci rachel zegler struggl convey sens emot charisma snow white wooden unengag presenc screen charm warmth damp sock support cast fare better usual reliabl gal gadot ben kingsley phone perform direct equal uninspir chri buck marc webb fail bring sens wonder magic proceed action scene dull uninspir special effect look like rip straight video game music forgett unmemor none icon song origin disney classic make appear perhap biggest problem snow white complet lack origin stori lazi retread origin fairi tale new twist surpris speak film attempt humor fall flat joke feel forc unnatur pace slow plod long stretch bore exposit fail engag,-0.9153,0.128,0.183,0.689,Negative
"If you want to preserve the cherished memories of your childhood, I strongly advise against watching this movie. Some stories are best left untouched, remaining as beautiful, nostalgic moments in our minds. However, this film takes those beloved memories and distorts them into something unrecognizable. If you grew up loving the original tale, this adaptation may leave you feeling disappointed, disheartened, or even frustrated.

Furthermore, if you have children and are considering taking them to see this movie, you may want to think twice. Children are especially sensitive to visuals, and this film, rather than offering a magical, heartwarming experience, may instead introduce them to unnecessary fear. If your goal is to protect them from nightmares, then it would be wise to choose another film, one that truly embodies the spirit of wonder and adventure that fairy tales are meant to inspire. Rather than enchanting young viewers, this movie might unsettle them, leaving them with eerie images rather than joyful dreams.

One of the few redeeming qualities of the film might be the seven CGI dwarfs. In a movie that struggles in many other aspects, the visual effects team seems to have done a commendable job in bringing these characters to life. The animation and rendering of the dwarfs are well-executed, offering some of the only moments of genuine charm throughout the film. While CGI in modern films can often feel artificial or lifeless, the dwarfs in this adaptation manage to have some personality and visual appeal, providing at least a small highlight in an otherwise lackluster experience.

However, impressive CGI alone is not enough to save a film that falters in storytelling, character development, or emotional depth. While the technology used to create the dwarfs might be impressive, it does little to mask the shortcomings of the film as a whole. A movie should offer more than just visual spectacle-it should captivate, inspire, and transport its audience into a world worth believing in. Unfortunately, this adaptation fails to achieve that, leaving viewers with little more than a sense of disappointment.

In the end, if you value the magic and purity of the story you once knew, this film might not be the right choice for you. There are plenty of other adaptations and interpretations of classic fairy tales that do justice to their original magic and wonder. Instead of risking the disappointment that this movie might bring, consider revisiting the versions of the story that made you fall in love with it in the first place. Whether it's an animated classic, a beautifully written book, or even a stage adaptation, there are countless ways to experience the magic of this story without subjecting yourself to an underwhelming film.

For those who are still curious about the movie, perhaps the best approach is to manage expectations. If you go in expecting a faithful, heartfelt adaptation, you might leave feeling let down. But if you watch it with the understanding that it may take creative liberties, alter the tone, and possibly even stray far from the heart of the original, then you might be able to find small moments of enjoyment-especially in the CGI work. Just don't expect it to leave you with the same warmth and wonder that the original story once did.

Ultimately, the choice is yours, but be prepared. Whether it's protecting your childhood memories or shielding young viewers from unsettling imagery, there are valid reasons to be cautious about this film. If nothing else, at least we can acknowledge that the visual effects team put in the effort to make the seven dwarfs look good. Unfortunately, that alone may not be enough to make this movie worth watching.",1/10,want preserv cherish memori childhood strongli advis watch movi stori best left untouch remain beauti nostalg moment mind howev film take belov memori distort someth unrecogniz grew love origin tale adapt may leav feel disappoint dishearten even frustrat furthermor child consid take see movi may want think twice child especi sensit visual film rather offer magic heartwarm experi may instead introduc unnecessari fear goal protect nightmar would wise choos anoth film one truli embodi spirit wonder adventur fairi tale meant inspir rather enchant young viewer movi might unsettl leav eeri imag rather joy dream one redeem qualiti film might seven cgi dwarf movi struggl mani aspect visual effect team seem done commend job bring charact life anim render dwarf offer moment genuin charm throughout film cgi modern film often feel artifici lifeless dwarf adapt manag person visual appeal provid least small highlight otherwis lacklust experi howev impress cgi alon enough save film falter storytel charact develop emot depth technolog use creat dwarf might impress littl mask shortcom film whole movi offer visual captiv inspir transport audienc world worth believ unfortun adapt fail achiev leav viewer littl sens disappoint end valu magic puriti stori knew film might right choic plenti adapt interpret classic fairi tale justic origin magic wonder instead risk disappoint movi might bring consid revisit version stori made fall love first place whether anim classic beauti written book even stage adapt countless way experi magic stori without subject underwhelm film still curiou movi perhap best approach manag expect go expect faith heartfelt adapt might leav feel let watch understand may take creativ liberti alter tone possibl even stray far heart origin might abl find small moment cgi work expect leav warmth wonder origin stori ultim choic prepar whether protect childhood memori shield young viewer unsettl imageri valid reason cautiou film noth els least acknowledg visual effect team put effort make seven dwarf look good unfortun alon may enough make movi worth watch,0.9926,0.185,0.058,0.757,Positive

"Oh boy, Disney's Snow White-where do I even start? This movie is like a poisoned apple that looks shiny on the outside but leaves you gagging after one bite. First off, Snow White herself is so annoyingly chipper, I half-expected her to break into a sales pitch for a timeshare with those woodland critters. Speaking of which, those animals deserve an Oscar for tolerating her off-key warbling while they scrub floors-meanwhile, I'm over here wishing the Evil Queen would hurry up with the inevitable.

The dwarves? More like seven little reasons to question my life choices. Grumpy's the only one with a brain, and even he couldn't save this snooze-fest. The plot moves slower than Sleepy after a double espresso wears off, and the Prince? Dude shows up for five seconds, kisses a coma patient without consent, and we're supposed to call it romance. Disney magic? More like Disney tragic. I'd rather watch paint dry-at least it wouldn't whistle while it worked. Two stars, and that's just for the Queen's mirror, who clearly knew how to throw shade.

The whole thing was way too flashy, with these bright colors and effects that just screamed ""look at me!"" instead of telling a good story.

"Honestly, this movie felt like a bland rehash of a story we've seen a hundred times. The characters were flat, the pacing dragged, and the ""modern twists"" just didn't land. Even the visuals, which could've saved it, were underwhelming. It's like they tried to reinvent the wheel and ended up with a triangle. Not worth the time.

Let's start with the characters. Snow White herself, played with little nuance, comes across more like a background character in her own story. She lacks the emotional depth or personality needed to carry the film, and unfortunately, the writing doesn't do her any favors either. The dialogue is stiff, forced, and at times painfully cringe-worthy, trying to sound modern and empowering but ending up awkward and shallow.

The Evil Queen, usually the highlight of any Snow White adaptation, is reduced here to a caricature. Her motivations are unclear, her presence is inconsistent, and the performance feels half-baked. It's hard to take her seriously when she flips between cartoonish villain and misunderstood anti-hero without any real development or justification.

"Rachel Ziegler and her acting type were truly miscast in this role, or the notes she was given were truly abhorred. At no time could I see my children liking her portrayal and personally, comparing to the original, it felt the entire tone of her performance was a miss.

As Ziegler doesn't seem able to envoke any form of sympathy from crowds it seems, maybe she'd be better suited sticking to supporting roles or another genre if fairytales aren't within her range.

There are always risks when deviating from the source material but honestly it just seemed like a better point of focus would have made a world of difference and perhaps some of the changes would have been welcomed with a more palatable lead to feed them to us.

"When the Queen looks at her magic mirror it clearly is faulty and probably delivered from a cheap knock-off from the real thing.

Gal Gadot is a goddess in every sense a beautiful woman, who should have no issues getting jealous of another woman's looks.

Rachel Zegler is just average, not someone I'd crawl over broken glass with my flies open to try and bag a kiss from.

Here the fundamental flaws in the films logic are laid bare, Rachel can sing .. but that's about it.

The film after its disastrous reshoots which meant it was delayed for over a year, it manages to shoehorn in some horrendous cgi dwarves along with bandits ???. Bandits ????, now forgive me but I do not recall these being in the original. It's pretty evident that these were the original magical beings or poor substitutes for the dwarves and the film couldn't structurally exist without them due to the footage that had already been filmed.

The film follows certain beats from the original initially before deciding it wants to be something else, and the mediocre songs do not help either.

You also know there's a massive issue with the film when they've literally dropped the 'Seven Dwarfs' from the title and simply called it 'Snow White'. The holy grail of the Disney legacy is subsequently crucified in the name of a modern re-invention of the classic and believe me I am furious that Disney didn't have the respect for the original and hired an actress in the lead who has nothing but contempt for it.

"I genuinely don't know where to begin with this film. Maybe by saying this: it's a tragedy. Not the good Shakespearean kind either-just a full-on disaster. As someone who grew up loving the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I walked into this remake hoping for even a spark of that old Disney magic. Instead, I walked out confused, disappointed, and a little bit angry. This movie is the exact opposite of what Snow White is supposed to be.

Let's talk about the casting, because I think it's the core of the problem. Snow White is supposed to be this radiant, kind, innocent girl who lights up the forest with her goodness and charm. The actress in this version? Not even close. I'm not trying to be mean, but she had none of the softness or warmth you expect from Snow White. Her performance felt stiff, robotic even, and honestly... she seemed more annoyed than enchanted by anything around her. Where's the wonder? Where's the sweetness? There was nothing graceful or inspiring about her, and that's heartbreaking because Snow White is supposed to inspire.

And don't even get me started on the seven dwarfs. Or should I say... the ""weird background group of people who kind of live in the woods and are just there."" They completely stripped the dwarfs of their individual personalities. In the original, each dwarf was unique-Grumpy was grumpy, Dopey was adorable, Doc was wise. That's what made them memorable. But in this remake, they're like an awkward side quest no one wants to click on. They felt like they were just thrown into the movie out of obligation.

Visually? Meh. The colors were muted, the forest didn't look magical-it looked like someone tried to film Lord of the Rings on a budget in their backyard. There was no enchantment. The original had charm dripping out of every frame-those little forest animals helping Snow White, the cozy little cottage, the sparkle of the wishing well. This version tried to be ""modern"" and ""gritty"" or whatever, but in the process, it lost its soul.

And then there's the writing. It felt like someone who didn't even like fairy tales wrote this script. Snow White didn't grow as a character-she just existed, said a few snarky lines, and that was it. There was no heart. No real lesson. And honestly, no real love either. The Prince (if you can even call him that) was barely in the film and felt like an afterthought. The romantic element, which in the original added such emotional depth, was completely gone. I get that times have changed and stories evolve, but changing everything doesn't make it better. Especially when you replace charm with attitude and wonder with bland empowerment slogans.

Disney had the perfect opportunity here. They could have remastered the 1937 version, added a few visual tweaks, maybe even extended a few scenes. That would've been worth watching. That would've made people cry with nostalgia. Instead, they delivered a half-baked modern mess that disrespects its own legacy.",1/10,genuin know begin film mayb say tragedi good shakespearean kind disast someon grew love origin snow white seven dwarf walk remak hope even spark old disney magic instead walk confus disappoint littl bit angri movi exact opposit snow white suppos let talk cast think core problem snow white suppos radiant kind innoc girl light forest good charm actress version even close tri mean none soft warmth expect snow white perform felt stiff robot even honestli seem annoy enchant anyth around wonder sweet noth grace inspir heartbreak snow white suppos inspir even get start seven dwarf say weird background group peopl kind live wood complet strip dwarf individu person origin dwarf grumpi dopey ador doc wise made memor remak like awkward side quest one want click felt like thrown movi oblig visual meh color mute forest look look like someon tri film lord ring budget backyard enchant origin charm drip everi littl forest anim help snow white cozi littl cottag sparkl wish well version tri modern gritti whatev process lost soul write felt like someon even like fairi tale wrote script snow white grow exist said snarki line heart real lesson honestli real love either princ even call bare film felt like afterthought romant element origin ad emot depth complet gone get time chang stori evolv chang everyth make better especi replac charm attitud wonder bland empower slogan disney perfect opportun could remast version ad visual tweak mayb even extend scene would worth watch would made peopl cri nostalgia instead deliv modern mess disrespect legaci,0.9947,0.258,0.083,0.659,Positive
"I even fell asleep and my 7 year ikd went all the movie saying... SO FAKE, Why is the Snow white angry? (just her face erupting his wokness bitter), why is the witch queen jealouse? She's prettier. Don't waste your money.

Disney's latest live-action Snow White is a complete disaster, failing on nearly every level. From its uninspired lead actress to its soulless CGI, the film is a far cry from the timeless charm of the original. Worse still, its rewritten dialogues strip away the warmth and values that made the classic story beloved, replacing them with a hollow, antisocial message that alienates its audience.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is one of the film's biggest weaknesses. She lacks the grace, innocence, and charm that made the original character so endearing. Instead of portraying a kind and humble princess, her version feels smug and detached, making it impossible to root for her. Her line delivery is often flat or overly self-assured, further distancing her from audiences expecting a sincere, heartfelt performance.

Visually, the film is just as unconvincing. The CGI-heavy effects strip the movie of any sense of realism or magic. The so-called ""dwarfs"" look like a lazy, computer-generated afterthought, draining the film of any personality. The artificial landscapes and overprocessed lighting make every scene feel plastic and soulless, turning what should be a visually rich fairytale into something that resembles a cheap video game cutscene.

Perhaps the most frustrating part is the film's complete disregard for the themes that made Snow White a beloved story in the first place. The rewritten dialogues turn what was once a tale of kindness, resilience, and family into an awkward, disjointed narrative that pushes an individualistic and almost antagonistic attitude toward traditional values. The result is a film that doesn't just fail to connect with the audience-it actively pushes them away.

In the end, Snow White is nothing more than a misguided, joyless attempt at modernizing a classic. Instead of honoring the legacy of the original, it distorts it beyond recognition, leaving audiences with nothing but disappointment.",1/10,even fell asleep year ikd went movi say fake snow white angri face erupt wok bitter witch queen jealous prettier wast money disney latest snow white complet disast fail nearli everi level uninspir lead actress soulless cgi film far cri timeless charm origin wors still rewritten dialogu strip away warmth valu made classic stori belov replac hollow antisoci messag alien audienc rachel zegler perform snow white one film biggest weak lack grace innoc charm made origin charact endear instead portray kind humbl princess version feel smug detach make imposs root line deliveri often flat overli distanc audienc expect sincer heartfelt perform visual film unconvinc effect strip movi sens realism magic dwarf look like lazi afterthought drain film person artifici landscap overprocess light make everi scene feel plastic soulless turn visual rich fairytal someth resembl cheap video game cutscen perhap frustrat part film complet disregard theme made snow white belov stori first place rewritten dialogu turn tale kind resili famili awkward disjoint narr push individualist almost antagonist attitud toward tradit valu result film fail connect activ push away end snow white noth misguid joyless attempt modern classic instead honor legaci origin distort beyond recognit leav audienc noth disappoint,-0.1796,0.146,0.157,0.698,Negative
"I saw an earlier screening and im in a complete and utter shock. I understand that pleasing a certain demographic is important these days but still could have done in a more artistic way. Everything in this movie from casting to screen play to the story is just pure cringe.

Rachel Zegler lacks charisma and has the amazing ability to change pleasant situations into cringe. Not taking into consideration her behavior before the release of this movie and simply on the merit alone she is robotic and lacks charisma and is not charming at all.

Gal Gadot though being drop dead gorgeous always lacked charisma and is an average actress at best. She has no real facial expression and almost sometimes feel like an android and made no effort to correct it during this movie.

The story is just complete orphan after the first 20 mins. The band wagon just completely falls off the track into a weird story making sure the male lead is degraded in every scene if possible.

"I've always been a huge fan of Disney movies - their magic, music, and memorable characters have been a part of my life since childhood. So when I sat down to watch this film, I was genuinely excited and hopeful. Unfortunately, that excitement quickly turned into disappointment, and by the end, I was left in complete disbelief.

This was, without a doubt, the worst Disney film I have ever seen. The storyline lacked heart, the pacing was off, and the emotional core that usually defines a Disney movie was nowhere to be found. But the most shocking part of all was Gal Gadot's performance. Her acting was stiff and unconvincing, completely devoid of the warmth or depth that the character required. It was painfully clear that she was miscast, and her presence only dragged the film further down.

What makes it worse is the fact that this movie tried to build on a beloved original - and failed miserably. Instead of honoring what made the original special, it felt like a hollow imitation, filled with glossy visuals but no soul. It was not just a letdown - it was almost offensive to fans who hold the original dear.

If it were possible to give a negative rating, I wouldn't hesitate. Watching this movie felt like a waste of time, and I genuinely regret pressing play. My advice? Spare yourself the disappointment.

"Well, basically-they fail on the basics.

What really caught me off guard was who ended up disappointing me the most. I went in expecting issues elsewhere, but surprisingly, it was Gal Gadot who stood out in all the wrong ways. I genuinely didn't expect her to be the weak link, but her performance felt undercooked and surprisingly rookie for someone of her experience. It lacked the depth and presence you'd hope for, especially given the iconic role she was playing.

Then there's the scenery-or rather, the lack of it. It felt lazy and uninspired, like they cut corners on the visuals that are supposed to give fairy tales their magic. The sets didn't pull you into the world; they pushed you out of it.

And don't even get me started on the costume design. It was oddly offbeat, almost like the characters were wearing outfits from a different movie entirely. The clothing lacked that timeless, fantastical charm and instead came across as cheap or hastily thrown together.

Overall, it just didn't click.

"Something is off, wery off.

Skipping the story, going directly to the glaring issue.

The film never connects with me as a viewer. Something always reminds me that what I am seeing is fake. And sure, I know that Alien, ET, Terminator and Avatar also was fake, but there are key differences to those movies and Snow white. I love Terminator, one of the best action movies ever mad. And Avatar left me disappointed with the real world, to gray and boring.

Snow White, it never connects.

The story is written as if it's only purpose is to meet the schedule or budget. Write something that fits into 1 hour and 45 minutes.

The acting feels forced and like Rachel said: I didn't like the original movie. Translation: I want fame and money, but I dont care for the movie or viewer.

And storytelling, just fits the standard Hollywood motto. Nothing that challenge or makes me connect.

And the sets, everything feels and looks fake. An edited Rachel in an edited Forrest, with fake elves.

Speaking of the dwarfs, I went into this movie without knowing anything. I was SHOCKED to discover afterwards the dwarfs were (and still are) CGI! They look so real and lifelike, like Yoda from Star Wars.

I can only imagine how foolish Hollywood feels for having its Oscar ceremony before Snow White was released, because clearly it would have won every category!

"My Review- Snow White In Cinemas now My Rating 8/10 First some background to one of the most trouble plagued movies to almost never hit the screen however it's here at last and I and my favourite movie partner really enjoyed it.

Isn't it ironic that the 1938 classic cartoon feature Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was widely credited with saving Walt Disney Animation Studios from financial ruin and launching the ""Disney Renaissance"" in 2025 is their biggest liability if it bombs at the box office .

The estimated production budget including marketing of this new live feature version of Snow White is could reach between $300 million and $470 million USD so to make a profit would need to make $700 million at the World Wide box office .

The original 1938 cartoon feature had an estimated production budget of $USD 1.5 million and world box office is approximately an outstanding $USD 185 million.

The plagued journey of this semi live action of Snow White to the screen began back in 2019 when pre production was held up due to Covid since then there have been setbacks by the far right purists following comments by Peter Dinklage alleging the original film depicted the dwarfs in a negative light, Disney announced on January 25, 2022, that they would approach the characters differently, while also consulting members of the dwarfism community. Many fans of the original including Dylan Postl pointed out that many of Dinklage's remarks were incorrect. For one, he said the dwarfs lived in a cave. They actually lived in a very nice cottage and worked in a diamond mine.

There's been much more behind the scenes drama since then you can't please everyone if you expect the exact story featured in the superb 1938 Academy Award animated feature think again because the creative team on this 21st Century version have I think very cleverly turned Snow White into a heroine that little girls and young women can be proud of .

Rachel Zegler is perfect for the role she's not saccharine sweet however her portrayal of the outcast princess who's life is spared by the woodsman sent to kill her and return her heart to her evil stepmother now Queen has strength and conviction.

The evil Queen played so well by Gal Gadot is suitably sinister as she vainly consults her magic mirror . In this new version like others in the cast she even gets a new very effective song and production number.

These new songs that fit in well with the few much loved songs from the original like Heigh Ho Heigh Ho ,Whistle While You Work were composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul of La La Land (2016), The Greatest Showman (2017), and the Tony award winning Broadway musical ""Dear Evan Hansen"".

Apart from Snow White the most loved characters of course in the story are The Seven little men whose untidy cottage becomes Snow Whites refuge.

In this version they are equally loveable their GGI forms known as (motion capture/puppeteer unlike the original cartoon version the actors providing their voices all get screen credit and deserve it they provide Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey ,especially Dopey in this version their charm and humour.

Snow White in this version isn't stuck at home cleaning house for seven men she's off on a quest to try and locate her banished father on the way she is befriended by a dashing Robin Hood like outlaw called Jonathan and his not so merry men I thought this worked well as they are rebels who want to defy the Evil Queen's monarchy Jonathan is a new character played with great charm by Andrew Burnap and created for the film as Snow White's love interest (partially based on the Prince from the original film) however Snow White in this new version is not looking for romance or rescue by any Prince she's a young independent woman who is on a quest to save her kingdom from her wicked step mother.

If you are expecting a faithful retelling of The famous 1812 Brothers Grim fairy tale or a live action faithful version of the 1938 Cartoon feature you might be disappointed.

New interpretations of classic stories by Shakespeare ,Ibsen, Voltaire Tolstoy and all great authors have been in production for ever so this new retelling of a classic much loved story I hope proves its detractors wrong and I hope it's a great success.

Congratulations to Director Marc Webb and Erin Cressida Wilson who wrote this reimagined version of Jacob and Wilhelmina Grimm's classic .

"I'm going to be completely honest - I didn't love it. In fact, I think Disney has well and truly lost its way. And before anyone jumps to the usual debates about casting or politics, that's not even the real issue here. The real problem is that these live-action remakes have become utterly soulless. They're missing the heart, the wonder, the sheer magic that made the originals so special.

'Snow White' should feel like a fairytale, something enchanting and timeless, but instead, this just felt... flat. The visuals were fine, the acting was actually decent, and the reimagining of the dwarfs (or ""magical companions"") wasn't as bad as I'd feared. But it all felt like a box-ticking exercise rather than a film made with love or passion.

Disney keeps trying to modernise these classics, but they seem to have forgotten why people fell in love with them in the first place.

"Outside of all of the bias for the film, it is clear that the movie was meant to be one story, but attempted to add parts of the original. The first story planned for this adaptation was mixed into the first animated film, creating a confusing climax and resolution. Also, the main point of removing the Prince from the 1937 movie was to make it clear that Snow White was independent and did not need a man to save her. Even if a princess falls in love with a powerful man, she is no weaker than a single one. For example, Mulan was the hero of China but still had a love interest that had a role in the army. She is considered the most skilled princess, even if she has a lover. After the backlash against this change, they replaced the Prince with a bandit (sounds like Aladdin, no?). The soundtrack bears little resemblance to the original film rather than creating supposedly new, empowering songs. While the costumes show the magic of Disney, the only one that resembles the original film is Snow White's dress, with the others bearing a slight resemblance to their counterparts. The terrifying CGI of the dwarfs appears quickly made to meet the planned release date, Rachel Zegler has little-to-no resemblance to the original Snow White (especially in the singing. Where is her famous whistle-like voice?), and Gal Gadot's performance does not appear worth 15 million dollars.

"I was there watched this movie, and it this movie, and it was absolute disappointed. Why i'm use words "" A Live action Disney Folly"". Compared to the original version, Snow White and the Seven dwarfs animated version is better than the remakes. Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. As Gold Member of D23, rachel zegler is the one who blame with, she's disrespecting the movie ever since she put her mouth at the D23 Expo 2 years ago and i'm tired of being humbled I'm tired to be speechless, if Walt is alive, he'll fire her for good.

Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive and even worse, disrespecting the original animate movie. Snow White is one of those dull ones Absolute horrid . Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial.

Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.

The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been. Queen should have been.

Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm Casting Rachel

Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.

Weak CGI and Bland Visuals: For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar.

The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts.

The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.

Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack The one highlight o film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous

Despite some good looking designs on the backgrounds and all, it was really boring. Marc Webb tries his best but unfortunately, really little about this would ever work.

Please, audiences for gods sake. Stop giving the remakes a chance. Save the money and go watch Snow White and the seven dwarfs (1937) instead of the live action Disney folly.

"Disney's new live-action Snow White is a colossal disappointment that fails to recapture the timeless enchantment of its classic animated version. The film is riddled with a poorly constructed narrative that feels both forced and unimaginative, relying on stale tropes and clumsy dialogue.

"It appears that Snow White 2025 can't even escape the apparent IMDb manipulation by bots to dramatically drive down its ratings and the Israeli-Palestinian controversy and casting Rachel Zegler whose American father and Columbian mother creating a ""non-white"" character backlash. Even with these controversies aside it is hard not to ignore the current political divide for those aware of the emotional turmoil besetting the United States and the plotline of the movie as dramatically displayed on screen. Nevertheless in sending these non-cinematic concerns to the backseat, this movie has its rich musical, lyrical charm, strong singing numbers, and a harder dramatic edge that even appears to have some young children captivated. There is plenty of wry humor, timely musical numbers, and good pacing except for a moment in the middle of the movie and one musical number that could easily have been edited out. The underlying message of cooperation, fairness, and kindness, and, yes, getting along with others from all walks of life form a backbone of this movie in the form of Rachel Zegler as the titular Snow White. Gal Gadot also offers up a strong evil character with her own snazzy musical piece and performance as the wicked stepmother and sometimes creepy, appealing hag.

"Snow White, the latest in Disney's line of uninspiring remakes, is an effort that slightly surpassed my expectations. Not something I think will be fondly remembered, but the vitriol in reaction to its existence seems especially unearned.

The writing is quite average, but I appreciate that it tries a somewhat fresh take. While not diverging too much from the basic narrative of the 1937 film, it tries to add depth to Snow White and the substitute Prince character and extends the runtime by some other means. Not groundbreaking, but I at least felt like I was watching an actual re-adaptation of the source material instead of just a CGI'd up live action rendition of the original movie. Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella was one where it stuck very close to the original while barely adding anything of substance, making it feel hollow despite very nice filmmaking. Sure, I'd say it's a better overall film than this Snow White, but the latter is the format I would prefer a remake to follow.

The technical aspects of the movie could have been improved upon. The cinematography and color grading do very little to make it a visually exciting experience although nothing was distractingly bad. The visual effects, however, were distracting. The animals take on a cartoonish appearance but that only serves to make them look fake the entire time. The dwarfs are the worst offender; their designs are just unappealing and there's a degree of uncomfortability every time they're on screen, especially Dopey. The ""Heigh-Ho"" sequence, which is likely 100% CGI, is probably the worst part of the movie. Making the dwarfs live action would probably have made the movie overall more palatable.

The music is solidly executed. It does away with a large part of the music from the 1937 film, and the new songs are alright. I think I would've preferred the music to sound ""bigger"", and there is some noticeable autotune, but I found this movie to definitely handle music better than some of the other remakes.

Snow White is just another Disney remake but I found it justifies its existence more than some others in the lineup. I've seen almost all of the recent ones and I definitely prefer the likes of Pete's Dragon and Dumbo to Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Snow White isn't particularly impressive, but it did hold my attention and my impression was overall positive despite some hiccups.",6/10,snow white latest disney line uninspir remak effort slightli surpass expect someth think fondli rememb vitriol reaction exist seem especi unearn write quit averag appreci tri somewhat fresh take diverg much basic narr film tri add depth snow white substitut princ charact extend runtim mean groundbreak least felt like watch actual sourc materi instead cgi live action rendit origin movi kenneth branagh cinderella one stuck close origin bare ad anyth substanc make feel hollow despit nice filmmak sure say better overal film snow white latter format would prefer remak follow technic aspect movi could improv upon cinematographi color grade littl make visual excit experi although noth distractingli bad visual effect howev distract anim take cartoonish appear serf make look fake entir time dwarf worst offend design unapp degre uncomfort everi time screen especi dopey sequenc like cgi probabl worst part movi make dwarf live action would probabl made movi overal palat music solidli execut away larg part music film new song alright think would prefer music sound bigger notic autotun found movi definit handl music better remak snow white anoth disney remak found justifi exist other lineup seen almost recent one definit prefer like pete dragon dumbo beauti beast lion king snow white particularli impress hold attent impress overal posit despit hiccup,0.6915,0.123,0.087,0.791,Positive

The evil queen didnt really feel like that character was delivered very well and the 7 dwarfs did look a little scary.

"Disney's Snow White is an absolute trainwreck, managing to fumble everything from storytelling to casting to visual effects. The so called modern update strips away all the charm, heart, and magic of the original, leaving behind a hollow, uninspired mess that alienates fans while failing to offer anything meaningful in return.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and innocence that made the character iconic, and the film's attempt to turn her into a strong and independent leader feels forced and out of place. The dwarfs have been controversially reimagined in a way that removes their personality, and the absence of a real Prince entirely erases one of the story's core elements. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, while visually striking, delivers a performance that is more stale than menacing.

The CGI is embarrassingly bad for a blockbuster of this scale, and the film's attempts at humor fall flat. Worst of all, it lacks the timeless magic that made Disney's classic fairy tales so beloved.

"For a movie steeped in the rich legacy of Disney's animated classic, Snow White 2025 falls flat in almost every department. Despite the potential for a modern, enchanting live-action remake, this film feels overly artificial and devoid of genuine magic.

The sets and visuals seem contrived, leaving the audience longing for the lush, immersive environments of the animated original. The portrayal of the dwarfs, which should have been charming and central to the story's heart, comes across as uninspired and awkwardly handled.

Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen is a major disappointment. While her striking appearance is undeniable, her portrayal lacks the depth and menace needed to embody such an iconic antagonist. Moreover, Snow White's costume design and hairstyle feel strangely out of place, failing to evoke the timeless elegance of the character.

The musical elements, a key part of Disney's charm, lack the memorable tunes and emotional resonance audiences hope for. The overall film suffers from a lack of coherence, making the experience more cringe-worthy than captivating.

Disney has certainly taken bold creative liberties here, but unfortunately, most of them miss the mark.

"I was wondering how different would Disney's remake of its animated classic be, and it turns out to be really different. Instead of a Prince Charming, this time we have a bandit king. And Dopey, who looks like a cute version of Dobby from Harry Potter, turns out to actually be spunky.

The wicked Queen is played by the glamorous Gal Gadot, who is clearly relishing the chance to be a baddie. She is the fun one to watch. Rachel Zegler inhabits the titular role with sufficient conviction.

The songs by Pasek and Paul are not as memorable as their earlier works, although their version of Heigh-Ho is at least clever and feisty.

The biggest letdown has to be the kiss that broke the magic spell. It is supposed to be a true love's kiss but what we see is such a weak and hesitant attempt it is truly a miracle that it was enough to wake the unconscious princess.

"When it comes to adapting beloved classics for a modern audience, there's a tightrope to walk-one that balances reverence for the original with the demands of contemporary sensibilities. Unfortunately, the recent remake of Snow white stumbles badly on this tightrope, leaving fans like me longing for the unadulterated brilliance of the original. The plea is simple: the original movie was way better, and it's time to bring back the storyline that made it a timeless gem. Modernizing classics is a tricky endeavor, no doubt, but it has to be done right-or not at all.

The original movie, released decades ago, captured something pure and inimitable. Its storyline was a masterclass in specific genre or theme, e.g., suspense, romance, or adventure, weaving together key elements like character depth, pacing, or atmosphere into a narrative that resonated deeply. The characters felt alive, their motivations grounded in a world that made sense within the story's framework. It wasn't just entertainment; it was an experience-one that lingered long after the credits rolled. That magic, however, is glaringly absent in this latest iteration.

Where the original thrived on authenticity, the remake drowns in a sea of forced modernization. The decision to overhaul the classic storyline feels less like an evolution and more like a betrayal. Gone are the specific plot points or themes, e.g., slow-burn tension or heartfelt simplicity that defined the first film, replaced by a frenetic, trend-chasing mess that prioritizes flash over substance. It's as if the filmmakers decided that today's audiences couldn't handle the elegance of the original pacing or the nuance of its conflicts. Instead, we get specific examples, e.g., unnecessary subplots, CGI-heavy action, or shallow character reboots that clash with the soul of what made the movie special.

Modernizing a classic isn't inherently a bad idea-times change, and so do tastes. But there's a right way to do it, and this isn't it. Take a film like example of a successful remake, where updates enhanced the core story without sacrificing its essence. Those adaptations respected their source material, using new technology or perspectives to amplify what was already great. In contrast, this remake seems to misunderstand why the original worked. It's not enough to slap a fresh coat of paint on a masterpiece and call it progress; you have to honor the foundation while building something new. Here, the foundation feels bulldozed.

The performances, too, pale in comparison. The original cast brought a raw, unpolished energy that grounded the story-think specific actor or scene. The remake's actors, while talented, are saddled with dialogue and motivations that feel focus-grouped to death, stripping away the humanity that once shone through. Even the visuals, though technically impressive, lack the heart of the original's e.g., practical effects or cinematography. It's a textbook case of style over substance, a hollow echo of what came before.

Fans aren't asking for a shot-for-shot rehash-nostalgia alone doesn't sustain a film. But we deserve a return to the storyline that captivated us: one that trusts its audience, leans into its strengths, and doesn't bow to every modern trope. The modernization of classics can work when handled with care, but this remake proves that carelessness leads to disappointment. So here's a plea to the filmmakers: shelve the gimmicks, revisit the original blueprint, and give us back the story we fell in love with. Until then, I'll be rewatching the first movie, where the real magic still lives.",1/10,come adapt belov classic modern audienc tightrop balanc rever origin demand contemporari sensibl unfortun recent remak snow white stumbl badli tightrop leav fan like long unadulter brillianc origin plea simpl origin movi way better time bring back storylin made timeless gem modern classic tricki endeavor doubt done origin movi releas decad ago captur someth pure inimit storylin masterclass specif genr theme suspens romanc adventur weav togeth key element like charact depth pace atmospher narr reson deepli charact felt aliv motiv ground world made sens within stori framework entertain linger long credit roll magic howev glaringli absent latest iter origin thrive authent remak drown sea forc modern decis overhaul classic storylin feel less like evolut like betray gone specif plot point theme tension heartfelt simplic defin first film replac frenet mess priorit flash substanc filmmak decid today audienc could handl eleg origin pace nuanc conflict instead get specif exampl unnecessari subplot action shallow charact reboot clash soul made movi special modern classic inher bad chang tast right way take film like exampl success remak updat enhanc core stori without sacrif essenc adapt respect sourc materi use new technolog perspect amplifi alreadi great contrast remak seem misunderstand origin work enough slap fresh coat paint masterpiec call progress honor foundat build someth new foundat feel bulldoz perform pale comparison origin cast brought raw unpolish energi ground specif actor scene remak actor talent saddl dialogu motiv feel death strip away human shone even visual though technic impress lack heart origin practic effect cinematographi textbook case style substanc hollow echo came fan ask alon sustain film deserv return storylin captiv u one trust audienc lean strength bow everi modern trope modern classic work handl care remak prof careless lead disappoint plea filmmak shelv gimmick revisit origin blueprint give u back stori fell love rewatch first movi real magic still life,0.9862,0.192,0.098,0.711,Positive
"Another major failure for Disney. How can anyone think this was going to be good? Let's see...

First, let's cast an abrasive Snow White who isn't that attractive, who hates the original 1937 movie and puts it down publicly, who insults over half the population of the USA, is a loudmouth with her political views alienating countless people, and who has marginal talent at best. Not too smart.

Second, let's take out the actual dwarves and put in full-sized people instead. When that doesn't work, let's then CGI the dwarves in, because Hollywood Head Dwarf Peter Dinklage doesn't like any other dwarves in Hollywood getting much-needed jobs but him. After Dinklage's ""outrage"" at Disney possibly actually having dwarf actors in a retitled ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,"" CGI was used instead, and seven actors won't be getting Disney paychecks. Dinklage goes against his own people, what a guy!

Third, let's ""update"" a timeless story and very successful tale for ""modern"" audiences, at the same time ignoring that the ""modern"" audiences love the 1937 original, unlike the actress playing Snow White.

And quite a few other things.....what could go wrong?

Disney obviously had too much money in this to throw it away, otherwise it really should have gone the way of, say, ""Batgirl"" which supposedly was so bad that Warner Brothers simply refused to release it in theaters or anywhere. But that was ""only"" $90 million, much less than what ""Snow White"" costs, especially including marketing.

If one really has to see this, spare yourself the expense, but out of curiosity maybe glance at it when it eventually streams on Disney if you already have their channel.

But ""Snow White"" exists, and will surely be joke fodder for years to come.

But I wanted to give it a fair chance, to see it for myself and form my own opinion. And I'm so glad I did. This film is a wonderful and fresh reimagining of the classic tale we all know. It leans more into being a true musical, which adds so much heart and depth to the story. There were surprises throughout that completely caught me off guard, and several moments hit me emotionally in ways I never expected. I found myself tearing up more than once-not from nostalgia, but from the new ways the story brings out its magic. It's not a carbon copy of the original, and that's a good thing. It honors the spirit of the classic while breathing new life into it with bold storytelling choices, a powerful message, and enchanting visuals. It's a reminder of how timeless stories can evolve and still resonate deeply. I'll definitely be seeing it again-and I strongly recommend that everyone gives it a chance. Go into it with an open mind, and let the film speak for itself. Separate the performances from any outside noise about the cast's personal lives.

"Just got home after watching Snow White. Many of you are probably familiar with all the ridiculous drama surrounding the movie, and all of that just made me more curious about wanting to see it. I can admit that I was quite skeptical at first BUT I was actually very pleasantly surprised. It was almost the same as the original film from 1937 but with new scenes, new songs and new characters, and it actually worked. Rachel Zegler was a good fit for the role of Snow White. Gal Gadot as the Queen was a bit in between though it ranged from okay to terrible. The musical numbers were also well done, Pasek & Paul (who wrote the new songs) should get to write more Disney songs in the future Snow White's animal friends were incredibly cute and the 7 dwarfs were actually really funny, still a bit of an uncanny valley feeling about them but that disappeared quickly. The new character Jonathan (the prince's replacement) was quite okay and he had more character development than the prince in the original had.

Visually, the movie was underwhelming. The special effects looked cheap and outdated, and the cinematography lacked any creativity or flair. Even the soundtrack felt out of place, often distracting rather than enhancing the scenes.

The ""prince"" who wasn't even a prince was not likable. Just a guy off the street who played his rather confusing role poorly. It is hard to understand why the main characters supposedly fall in love with each other. There wasn't a point when a spark between them is seen. No chemistry whatsoever.

7 dwarfs who, it seems, were supposed to be some magical creatures, which would justifying their grotesque appearance, coexist with actual characters with dwarfism which is odd. Where did both types of ""dwarfs"" come from??

"Disney's latest Snow White movie leaves behind a sense of disappointment, particularly for fans of the original 1937 animated film. The magical, Bavarian elements of the classic film, such as Snow White's traditional dirndl dress, the castle that resembles Neuschwanstein, the Black Forest setting, the Bavarian wood carvings in the dwarfs' cottage are all missing in the new adaptation. Even the Evil Queen's potion glass, a Bavarian wine glass in the original, was part of the charm that connected the film to its Southern German roots. The Yodel Song was also drastically shortened in the new film. This cultural richness contributed to the original's charm, and its absence makes the new version feel ""hollow.""

Gal Gadot has a strong presence in the film, but the brief and not-scary transformation scene of the Evil Queen was a letdown, as it was one of the standout moments in the animated film.

The reason I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is that the new soundtrack is actually pretty catchy.

What can I say about this? First off, the OG Snow White wasn't really my cup of tea but then, it wasn't aimed at people like me but I still appreciate what it represents and it's cultural significance.

I'm well aware of all of the controversy surrounding the film and it's 'star' but I tried to give a go and take it for what it is.

It's trash.

The effects are awful, everything looks like it's drenched in some kind of yellow filter and it gives you a headache after about half an hour. I don't need to mention the dwarves as they've been memed to death by this point, they're nightmare inducingly bad. Although I will admit, some of the CGI animals were kind of cute.

Some of the acting is woeful, especially from Gal Gadot who I genuinely like but she's horribly miscast here. I felt genuinely sorry for her.

The story feels like it's been cobbled together from multiple different scrips, it almost feels like several different films stitched together and it's jarring. Most of it feels off and weirdly incoherent.

Shockingly, the one aspect of the film I thought I'd hate the most (as I can not stand the woman) was Rachel Zegler, but I didn't. She's actually not bad in the role and one thing is sure, she can't half sing. She's probably the best thing in this turkey and that shocks me to say.

The songs (though well sung) are terrible, the music is typical Disney live action remake fluff, full of huge orchestral and over the top melodies that just make you cringe.

It's just a mess of a film that shouldn't have been remade. It's has very few redeeming qualities and I couldn't wait for it to end, oh and as for the ending, i won't spoil it but it's as anti climactic as it gets, I was genuinely shocked at how it wrapped up, I was like 'Really? Somebody wrote that and it passed through several script doctors and producers' Wait until you see it, it's laughable.

I hate this film, it's one of the worst cinema experiences I've had but I owed it to my partner.

"This is a very sad review for me to write. I grew up with the original Disney classic animation films as a foundation or bedrock of my childhood. What I just saw would have Disney himself spinning in his grave. Everything about this movie is bad, but I have to say the performances of the main leads is really where it goes off the rails and into a sewer. Rachel Zegler might have talent, I don't know. But it certainly isn't clear from this film. She seemed an odd choice to play this role however. Gal Gadon't know how to act, on the other hand, this woman is bad. She can't act. I've seen her in half a dozen streamer films and it's the same schtick each time, and here we are again, the same schtick. She can't act, folks, it's as simple and as sad as that.

"Snow White is a beautiful retelling of a classic film. It has catchy music and amazing acting, while also presenting an incredibly creative story. An amazingly talented cast and gorgeous sets makes it feel truly magical.

Based on the 1937 classic Disney animated film, the story follows Snow White (Rachel Zegler), a princess who was hidden away by her stepmother, the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot), after her father left. After having enough of her stepmother, Snow White joins forces with seven dwarfs to bring her kingdom to peace once again while they help her take down the Evil Queen.

The songs in this film, composed by Jeff Morrow, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, are expertly crafted and catchy. Every song got stuck in my head until I heard the next one, and the incredible voice talent enhances them even more. My personal favorite has to be ""Whistle While you Work"" - Rachel Zegler's voice brings incredible energy and whimsy to the song, plus I love how the whistling is used in it. The sets and cinematography, directed by Mandy Walker, are also beautiful - the lighting stands out as it works perfectly and mixed with the magnificent sets creates a fantastic looking film. One shot I really love is when we first see the cottage in the forest. The costumes, designed by Sandy Powell, are also quite beautiful; however they don't all seem to go together. Each set of costumes feels like it was meant for a different time period, which feels a bit disconnected. I really like the Evil Queen's costumes; they're flawless and not only fit the kingdom, but also her character. The characters are really well scripted, and I love the actors for each of the key characters. I especially love Rachel Zegler's performance; the amount of emotion she shows brings so much life into her character and made me feel really sympathetic for her. This film had me enchanted the whole time through its story, songs and acting.

The film's message is to follow your morals and beliefs, even if it may not present easy decisions. Be warned that there are intense scenes and blood shown at some points.

I give Snow White 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to12. It releases in theaters March 21, 2025.

"This film is rather disturbing than charming. Many things have been said about this film. Walt Disney would be ashamed if he knew what they have made with this historical fairytale. Spoiler alarm: you will most likely be disappointed!

The magic and innocence of the original story are completely lost in this adaptation. Instead of a captivating fairy tale, we get a forced, modernized version that strips away the charm and depth of the classic. The characters feel hollow, the visuals lack the warmth and artistry of the original, and the storyline takes unnecessary liberties that add nothing of value.

It's as if the filmmakers were more interested in making a statement than in telling a compelling story. The emotional connection to Snow White and the dwarfs is missing, and the forced changes to the narrative feel more like an attempt to rewrite history rather than bring a beloved tale to life.

"Costume Design Inconsistencies:

A notable example is the character Jonathan's attire, which includes a modern jean jacket and hoodie. This choice clashes with the film's intended fantasy setting, leading to a disjointed visual experience.

Visual Effects and Character Representation:

The depiction of the seven dwarfs through CGI has been a point of contention. The animated dwarfs resemble lawn gnomes, which some viewers found awkward and lacking the charm of the original characters.

Narrative and Tonal Issues:

The film introduces complex new subplots but struggles to maintain a consistent tone. This results in a narrative that feels disjointed and fails to engage the audience effectively.

Character Portrayals:

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen has been criticized for lacking menace, with her performance oscillating between menacing and campy, leading to an inconsistent character depiction.

Controversial Modern Updates:

"This might just be the worst Disney live-action remake ever. The script is a total disaster-nothing makes sense, and it honestly feels like they were rewriting scenes on the spot without any real direction. The pacing is all over the place, the dialogue is cringey, and the whole thing feels like a rushed, half-baked mess.

Not a single moment in this Snow White feels engaging. It's not just that the lead actress seems totally miscast-the entire movie is filled with forced, unrealistic moments that completely pull you out of the story. Instead of creating something magical or meaningful, they shove in so many unnecessary changes and heavy-handed messaging that it's just exhausting to sit through. The balance between updating the story and keeping the heart of the original is completely off, making it feel more like a lecture than an actual movie.

Nothing flows naturally, and the lack of coherence makes it hard to care about anything happening on screen. The forced attempts to be modern feel incredibly awkward, and rather than feeling progressive or fresh, it just comes off as hollow and unnatural. It's hard to feel invested when everything feels like it was thrown together without much thought.

Rachel Zegler was perfectly cast as the titular character, and Gal Gadot's scene-stealing performance as the Evil Queen is delightful.

What worked:
Rachel Zegler's acting and singing. She surprisingly have life to Snow White (just ignore her bad wig, I still don't understand what the costume department was thinking.)
Dopey (loved the changes made to his character)
Jonathan and the way he was integrated to the story (Prince Charming was one of the weakest aspects of the original animated)
Character motivations also kind of worked for me.

"I must confess, I did it-my daughter convinced me to watch Disney's new Snow White today. And yes, the rumors you've been hearing are indeed true. This adaptation of Snow White feels hollow, completely lacking in genuine magic or charm.

The dialogues come off as forced and unnatural, almost as if the writers weren't sure themselves where the story was supposed to go. Speaking of the story, it struggles to find clarity or coherence, stumbling aimlessly from one scene to the next without any real sense of direction or purpose. Most of Disney's recent remakes haven't lived up to their originals, and this one is no exception. It felt as if Disney wanted to launch something but had no clear idea what or in which direction to go.

Rachel Zegler, who portrays Snow White, spends the entire movie looking like she's genuinely surprised she landed the role-and not in a good way. Her performance feels disconnected, as if she's impersonating Snow White rather than truly embodying her.

"I was initially very excited to see this movie. Considering I was never a big fan of the animated Snow White, I thought: how could they make it any worse? Well, somehow, they managed to succeed at that. I've always loved the live action Princess movies Disney would put out -except for Maleficent- but this was miserable. It lacked all the joy of a Disney film. The script was incredibly messy, and the acting was poor. Rachel Zegler was great for the most part and had a wonderful singing voice, but Gal Gadot was the worst Evil Queen I've ever seen. And Jonathan's outfits were hideous. The romance between Jonathan and Snow was supposed to be improved upon, but somehow made worse. The choreography was non existent, especially because this is a Disney musical. Some of the songs were good, but the lack of an interesting setting to them was it's downfall.

"The film's lack of cohesive storytelling and its failure to capture the magical essence associated with Disney classics. Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is described as unconvincing, with her portrayal lacking depth and charm. While her singing ability is acknowledged, her character comes across as overly passive and inconsistent. The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, is noted for her striking presence but is undermined by a script that fails to explore her motivations effectively.

Key plot points, such as Snow White's quest to find her father and the dynamics with the Seven Dwarfs, are riddled with inconsistencies and underdeveloped arcs. The narration by Dopey feels unnecessary and detracts from the story. Additionally, the film's tone awkwardly shifts between dark and whimsical, leaving viewers unsure of its intended audience.

Visually, the movie struggles to create an immersive fantasy world, and its small-scale production design detracts from the grandeur expected in a Disney remake. Ultimately, the film is disappointing and has sloppy execution and missed opportunities to modernize the story meaningfully.",1/10,film lack cohes storytel failur captur magic essenc associ disney classic rachel zegler perform snow white describ unconvinc portray lack depth charm sing abil acknowledg charact come across overli passiv inconsist evil queen play gal gadot note strike presenc undermin script fail explor motiv effect key plot point snow white quest find father dynam seven dwarf riddl inconsist underdevelop arc narrat dopey feel unnecessari detract stori addit film tone awkwardli shift dark whimsic leav viewer unsur intend audienc visual movi struggl creat immers fantasi world product design detract grandeur expect disney remak ultim film disappoint sloppi execut miss opportun modern stori meaning,-0.8316,0.072,0.154,0.774,Negative
"One of the worst Disney live-action remakes, and one of the worst Disney movies ever produced in their 88 years of filmmaking.

It's bad enough that Disney is remaking their first fully-animated feature film - their magnum opus - but this remake does nothing but a disservice to the legacy of the original and the legacy that Walt Disney left.

The filmmakers ""love Disney movies"" as said in the trailer above, but they did everything in their power to market how different this movie needs to be for ""modern audiences.""

And they do just that. They not only change the story in a major way, but they also cast an insufferable lead, even going as far to refuse roles from little people actors who wanted to play the dwarves.

As for the movie itself, the acting is horrid from Zegler and Gadot, the story is confusing, vapid, and meaningless. The movie is about an hour and a half, but feels longer than Oppenheimer.

"I went into the new Snow White movie hoping for a fresh take on the classic fairy tale. Instead, I got a joyless, uninspired mess that seems to miss the point of the original entirely.

First, let's talk about the script-if you can call it that. The film is so obsessed with ""modernizing"" the story that it strips away everything that made Snow White charming in the first place. Instead of a timeless fairy tale about kindness and overcoming adversity, we get a bland, preachy slog filled with forced dialogue and a protagonist who is about as likable as a soggy piece of toast.

The visuals? Disappointing. For a movie with Disney's budget, I expected something magical. Instead, the CGI looks rushed, and the film's overall aesthetic feels more like a low-budget streaming release than a major theatrical event. Gone is the whimsical artistry that made the original animation so iconic.

The performances don't save it either. The lead actress delivers a flat, uninspired performance, seemingly more interested in lecturing the audience than bringing Snow White to life. And don't get me started on the dwarfs-or rather, the lack thereof. Their replacements feel like an afterthought, completely missing the charm and heart that made the original characters so beloved.

Disney's attempts to ""reimagine"" this classic have resulted in a film that has neither the heart of the original nor the creativity to stand on its own. It's a lifeless, soulless attempt at storytelling that alienates fans while failing to attract a new audience.

"Disney Remake of it's own Snow White animation is misguided on it's attempt to completely revamp the core of the classic movie.

Even if we put the baggage that comes from that change aside, there's already other 'Snow White' adaptations that turned the eponymous character into a heroine in which Disney could take notes and lessons from.

Instead, this remake turns out to be the least charming and competent of them all.

The Evil Queen is barely charismatic and is probably the only non-low point of the movie.

The Prince is non-factor, which feels like both a wasted potential and a waste of screen time.

The Dwarves creates a tonal whiplash with the serious plot that this remake is attempting to pursue.

Not to mention the plot additions are all over the place, with some pay-offs have no set up and vice versa.

"Disney's new Snow White is not just a swing and a miss-it's a complete betrayal of the timeless fairy tale that generations have cherished. At the center of the mess is Rachel Zegler, whose portrayal of Snow White is shockingly lifeless and condescending. Rather than honoring the role with grace and wonder, she seems more interested in mocking the original character than embodying her. Her performance is cold, smug, and drenched in modern cynicism. It's hard to tell if she even wanted to be in this film, and frankly, it shows.

Gone is the charm, the innocence, the magic. Zegler's Snow White is stripped of all the qualities that made the character iconic, replaced with a preachy, joyless figure who feels utterly out of place in a fairy tale. It's less a performance and more of a statement-and a poorly delivered one at that.

The only redeeming aspect of this disaster is Gal Gadot, who actually seems to understand the assignment. As the Evil Queen, she brings elegance, charisma, and a theatrical flair that's both entertaining and visually captivating. She outshines Zegler in every scene they share and feels like she belongs in a much better film.

The dialogues come off as forced and unnatural, almost as if the writers weren't sure themselves where the story was supposed to go.

Most of Disney's recent remakes haven't lived up to their originals, and this one is no exception. It felt as if Disney wanted to launch something but had no clear idea what or in which direction to go.

Rachel Zegler, who portrays Snow White, spends the entire movie looking like she's genuinely surprised she landed the role-and not in a good way. Her performance feels disconnected, as if she's impersonating Snow White rather than truly embodying her.

"I can't even begin to express how infuriated I am after watching the latest adaptation of Snow White. This movie is an absolute travesty that fails on every level!

Instead of celebrating the traditional elements that made Snow White beloved for generations, the filmmakers decided to completely alter the character dynamics in an attempt to be ""progressive."" Newsflash: changing the essence of characters just for the sake of social commentary does NOT equal good storytelling!

Snow White herself feels more like a caricature than a character. She's portrayed as a rebellious teenager, full of angst, and completely dismisses the charm that made her story enchanting. The whimsical love story is reduced to a tired trope of ""I don't need a prince,"" diminishing the emotional core of the original tale. It's like they set out to remove every ounce of magic in favor of some misguided notion of empowerment.

And let's talk about the dwarfs. They've been re-imagined in a way that's not only ridiculous but also insulting. Instead of being endearing side characters, they come off as a jumbled mess of stereotypes with zero development. Their jokes fall flat, and it's clear that the writers were more focused on pseudo humor than crafting an engaging narrative.

The plot twists are not only predictable but also devoid of any real stakes. By the time we got to the climax, I found myself rolling my eyes rather than feeling any tension or excitement.

And the ending? Don't even get me started! It's a slap in the face to anyone who cherishes the original story.

If you're looking for the magic and wonder that Snow White used to bring, you won't find it here. This adaptation has completely misunderstood the heart of the story.

"This movie is horrible on so many different levels.

For one, the main character looks more like Lord Farquaad than the ""fairest in the land"".

The dwarfs are horrifying! Like they belong in a horror movie rather than a Disney classic. My kids were genuinely scared at first. I had to explain to calm them down several times.

The acting is bad, the scenery is too fake and artificial (way too much CGI).

I am amazed at how bad this movie is all around. It definitely feels like one of those bottom of the bin direct to DVD movies. But with those at least you know what you are signing up for.

Disney massively messed this movie up. How can Snow White (Rachel Zegler) be less attractive than the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot)? To me, it seems like Disney got the characters mixed up.

"I had high hopes for Snow White, but unfortunately, it was a major disappointment. The original Disney film was full of heart, charm, and magic-none of which made it into this dull and uninspired remake.

The acting was lackluster, with performances that felt forced and devoid of emotion. The lead actress failed to capture the warmth and innocence that made the original Snow White so beloved. Instead of feeling enchanted by the story, I found myself completely disconnected from the characters.

Beyond the acting, the film itself lacked the wonder and whimsy that made the classic so special. The visuals were uninspired, and the attempts to modernize the story only stripped it of its charm. Rather than bringing fresh life to a beloved tale, this remake felt like a soulless cash grab.

"Like re-imagining Homer's Odyssey or Shakespeare's Hamlet, or maybe trying to invent something important like the wheel, the path to failure is easy - not everyone is a Shakespeare or a Homer, and very few people really change the course of history with the inventions of their mind. This Snow White lacks a lot - no soul, no vision, just implementing whims of zeitgeist, but for defense: the rewriting and retelling of old fairy tales are old business - the true original stories are many times far too dark and cruel for children, at least for the offspring of modern times. Many stories people know are softened versions of the original stories. So in this sense, most of Disney's and Hollywood's fairy tales are nowhere true to the core of the original material. Anyway, this new disneyfied version is many times cringe-worthy for the forced zeitgeist ""improvements"", and in my opinion lacks of soul, like so many productions these days.

"Ah yes, Snow White (2024)-a film that bravely asks, ""What if we took a timeless classic and made it aggressively unlikable?"" My personal favorite part? When Snow White girlbossed the dwarfs into doing chores for her. In the original, she lovingly said, ""And I will use the broom."" But in this one? Nope. It's ""And HE will use the broom."" Nothing says empowerment like delegating housework to a group of hardworking men who were minding their own business. Truly inspiring.

But wait-why stop at ruining the dwarfs when you can also add seven completely pointless bandits? That's right, we got dwarfs AND bandits, and yet somehow, the film had double the characters and half the charm. These bandits were about as necessary as a glass slipper at a marathon. Seriously, why were they there? What was their purpose? Did they get lost on their way to a Robin Hood audition?

I physically walked out of this movie. Not metaphorically, not emotionally-I stood up and left. And honestly? I think even the Prince wanted out.

Rachel Zegler: ""I don't need a Prince to save me."" The Prince: ""Good, because I'm actually here for your stepmother.""

And can we please stop pretending that bad writing is excusable because ""it's for kids""? Children deserve good movies, not whatever this was. If you genuinely believe kids are too dumb to appreciate quality storytelling, I'd love to introduce you to Pixar, Harry Potter, and literally any Studio Ghibli film.

"Disney's 2025 live-action Snow White is an absolute trainwreck-easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. It manages to butcher a beloved classic with uninspired performances, baffling creative choices, and some of the worst casting decisions in recent memory.

Let's start with the biggest disaster of them all: Gal Gadot. Somehow, she delivers an even worse performance than in Wonder Woman 1984-which I didn't think was possible. As the Evil Queen, she's neither menacing nor captivating; she's just painfully bad. Her line delivery is wooden, her facial expressions are awkward, and her attempt at villainous charm is laughable. At times, it feels like she's struggling just to remember her lines, and her singing? It's borderline offensive. She completely lacks the gravitas needed for the role, making every scene she's in a chore to sit through. Disney needs to do everyone a favor and never cast her in a major role again.

Rachel Zegler, as Snow White, is equally lifeless. She doesn't embody the warmth or charm of the original character, instead coming off as entitled and irritating. The chemistry between her and the Prince (or whatever they tried to turn the love interest into) is non-existent. The film's attempt to modernize Snow White by removing core elements of her story makes her character feel directionless, further dragging the already weak script down.

Visually, the movie is an eyesore. The CGI dwarfs look atrocious, the sets lack any kind of magical charm, and the whole film has this weird, cheap, over-processed aesthetic that makes it look more like a straight-to-streaming knockoff than a $200+ million Disney blockbuster.

And let's not forget the music. The new songs are completely forgettable, adding nothing of value to the film. Meanwhile, any attempt at nostalgia with the classic songs is ruined by poor arrangements and even worse performances.

If Disney was hoping this would breathe new life into their live-action remakes, they've failed miserably. Snow White (2025) is an insult to the original and a complete waste of time.

The story was incoherent-scenes felt stitched together without any real flow, like they were just checking boxes off a badly written checklist. Snow White herself lacked personality, and the supporting characters were forgettable at best. The dwarves-or whatever they're calling them now-barely registered as characters. It felt like no one in the cast knew what kind of film they were supposed to be in.

Visually, it was dull. The sets looked like they came from a high-budget high school play, and the CGI somehow managed to feel both overused and cheap. And don't even get me started on the dialogue-it tried so hard to be modern and clever, but instead it came off as cringey and forced.

"Cuz this movie is chock full of it. Stinking, putrid, nauseating garbage.

Anytime a film is billed as ""reimagining"" a classic, that's new-speak code for ""made in a way that not only lacks charm, but goes the extra mile to offend people who enjoyed the original.

In the best moments it's very boring, but there aren't a lot of these ""best"" boring moments. Mostly you will have to endure bad acting, worse singing, cgi that is so off putting you have to close your eyes, and the whole time you're wondering what kind of hell your kid suckered you into watching.

Based on the hype, I was expecting an urban, hip, updated version of the original, which was made back in the Middle Ages, when humans first learned to draw pictures. Instead it's a ""reimagined"" version that lacks any appeal. If the original version has a soul, this version is its lifeless, zombie-Frankenstein evil descendant.

"Yes the dwarves are an abomination against art and morality Yes Gal Gadot is one of the worst actresses of all time, and might actually be the worst paid singer in a major film The portrayal of Snow White is what carries this film, she is a treat every time she is on screen

The additional plot line about having to over throw the Queen through popular revolution, is a little too close to real right now

"The new Snow White movie is an absolute mess, and Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is a major contributor to its downfall. Rather than delivering a menacing, commanding performance, Gadot's portrayal feels forced, as if she's reading lines without any genuine connection to her character. It's as though she believes just looking stern is enough to convince us she's evil, but the flat delivery and lack of depth only make her seem more like a confused villain than the sinister figure we're meant to fear. Her presence, instead of elevating the film, actually drags it down, making you wonder how such a talented actress could fall so short in such a pivotal role.

The character design, the dialogue, and the interactions feel disconnected and shallow, and Gadot doesn't help by underplaying what could've been a campy, exaggerated portrayal. It's not just bad-it's boring. Watching her attempt to hold her own against Snow White is like watching paint dry. If the Evil Queen is supposed to be a complex and captivating character, she's anything but here.

"I just had the misfortune of witnessing the butchered remains of a beloved Disney classic, Snow White. The 2025 iteration, starring Rachael Zegler as the titular character, is an unmitigated disaster.

The film's troubled production history is well-documented, with numerous reshoots and last-minute changes that have resulted in a disjointed, tone-deaf mess. The CGI dwarfs, meant to be a technological marvel, come across as creepy and unconvincing. Real little people should have been cast for these roles. How far have you fallen, Disney? It's a shame, really, as the original's charm and character were deeply rooted in the memorable performances of the Seven Dwarfs.

But the real travesty here is Rachael Zegler's involvement. Her vocal disdain for the original story and its supposed ""problematic"" themes is not only misguided but also reeks of opportunism. It's clear that she's more interested in pushing her own agenda than in genuinely bringing this character to life. Her acting, as always, was extremely subpar and flat. Her only talent is that she's an above average singer.

The sole bright spot in this catastrophe is Gal Gadot, who brings a sense of gravitas and depth to her role as the Evil Queen. Her performance is a masterclass in nuance and subtlety, elevating the entire production with her presence. It's a shame that her talents are wasted in this otherwise forgettable film.

Snow White (2025) is a mess, a soulless reimagining that fails to capture the magic and wonder of the original. Even the most ardent Disney fans will find themselves checking their watches, waiting for the agony to end. Avoid this monstrosity at all costs.

"All I have to say is I wish Disney could refund my ticket and also pay me for the 2 hours I sat in this movie. The previews of other movies were more interesting.

Originality 0. Nothing new here it's a remake and a bad one at that.

Story 1. A story that doesn't really know where it's going at time. I wish I knew where the writing was at in their thoughts? It seems like they were trying more or less to write with a point in mind then to recapture the magic of the original Grimm or Disney tale.

Effects. 1 The effects in this movie are poor. When the first snow white released it was ahead of it's time.

Costumes 1 I think Disney bought these costumes from Party City before they went bankrupt.

Music. 4 it's ok the singing is decent

Acting. 3 Gal Gadot is wearing the crown for a reason. Her performance is only thing that keeps this moving on point. She is a pretty and wicked queen. Rachel Zegler has her moments but they are few and far between. Most of the movie she seems to be forced in the plot because she is snow white. Very out of place. Ansu Kabia as the huntsman is not to scary and sometimes he's present in the movie with no presence. The dwarves are CGI so nothing good can come from that performance.

"I watched Disney's new Snow White-and wow, what a trainwreck. If the goal was to drain every ounce of charm, whimsy, and storytelling from the original and replace it with awkward performances and out-of-touch messaging, then mission accomplished.

Let's talk about Rachel Zegler. Her portrayal of Snow White felt like she accidentally wandered in from a completely different movie... and didn't bother reading the script. I've seen more emotion and sincerity in high school drama class performances. And that's just on set. Off set, her interviews came off as arrogant and dismissive-almost like she resented the fact that the original even existed. You'd think someone starring in an iconic remake would at least pretend to care.

This wasn't a modern reimagining. It was a complete dismantling of a classic tale in favor of something painfully forced and joyless. The writing was weak, the visuals felt bland despite the big budget, and the whole movie seemed to scream, ""Look how progressive we are!"" instead of telling a good story.",1/10,watch disney new snow wow trainwreck goal drain everi ounc charm whimsi storytel origin replac awkward perform messag mission accomplish let talk rachel zegler portray snow white felt like accident wander complet differ movi bother read script seen emot sincer high school drama class perform set set interview came arrog like resent fact origin even exist think someon star icon remak would least pretend care modern reimagin complet dismantl classic tale favor someth pain forc joyless write weak visual felt bland despit big budget whole movi seem scream look progress instead tell good stori,0.7181,0.219,0.17,0.611,Positive
"Disney's Snow White (2025) is proof that even when expectations are low, a movie can still find a way to disappoint.

From the start, there was plenty of skepticism about this remake, and unfortunately, the final product does nothing to change that. The film feels like it's trying so hard to be modern and different that it forgets what made the original special in the first place.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White feels forced and lifeless. The dwarfs-sorry, the ""magical outcasts""-are such a weird creative decision that they barely even feel like part of the story. Even Gal Gadot, who should've been an over-the-top, fun villain , is wasted on a bland and forgettable performance.

Visually, it's not much better. The CGI is inconsistent, the costumes feel cheap, and the whole thing lacks that classic Disney magic. The singing is properly the only thing that make it a bit more bearable.

"Boy never thought I'd have to say that about a Disney movie.

The only reason I'm writing a review is because I know there's going to be a ton a negativity here so trying to show the other side.

The beginning was a bit of a slog to get through; it was pretty sugary. Yes we know she had a wonderful family and everyone loved everyone else and then Mom died and Dad picked a terrible second wife. Blah blah blah But for all those rumors swirling about how Snow doesn't need a Prince apparently that didn't mean they weren't going to give us a male hero...in this iteration he's more or less a Robin Hood kind of guy. Kind of vanilla but it's a princess movie, right ?

The dwarves were a LOT to get past but you do actually get used to the weird CGI (not quite as creepy as the Polar Express) and they play their parts well enough.

Ludicrous that Disney used CGI for the Seven Dwarves and then in the next bit of the film there is an actual little person (can't say dwarf or Peter Dinklage will get mad🙄) who gets more character development than any of the Seven do.

Snow herself is very sweet but I can see for kids she would have her charm. The Evil Queen is a scenery chewing Gal Gadot, channeling her inner Joan Crawford in an interesting flip from her usual heroic roles. (be prepared --- she sings!! Very trashy and lots of fun) There's a lot of echoes from other films here, but as someone who has seen the original on the big screen (in a rerelease back in the 70s) and loved it for decades I can say this version is quite enjoyable. Was it necessary? No Is it vintage Disney? No Did it come out too close to Wicked? Yes!!!

Will you like it?

I don't know.

"The much-anticipated (or perhaps dreaded, depending on your perspective) ""Snow White 2025"" has unfortunately landed with a thud, proving to be a significant misstep for the studio. While numerous factors contribute to its overall failure, the most glaring and ultimately damaging aspect is the casting and subsequent performance of Rachel Zegler in the titular role. Instead of a fresh and captivating take on a beloved classic, we are presented with a Snow White who feels miscast, lacking the essential charm and vulnerability that define the character, ultimately dragging the entire film down with her.

From the outset, Zegler's portrayal struggles to capture the inherent innocence and gentle spirit traditionally associated with Snow White. Her performance often comes across as assertive and even slightly defiant, qualities that clash jarringly with the character's established persona. While some might argue for a ""modern"" take on Snow White, the changes feel less like empowering updates and more like a fundamental misunderstanding of the character's core essence. The audience struggles to connect with a Snow White who doesn't radiate the kindness and inherent goodness that makes her plight so compelling.

Furthermore, Zegler's vocal performance, while undoubtedly technically proficient, lacks the ethereal quality and emotional depth needed for the iconic songs. The musical numbers, instead of soaring and enchanting, often feel strained and disconnected from the emotional narrative. This is a significant blow to a story so deeply rooted in its musical heritage. The magic that should emanate from Snow White's voice is simply absent, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and nostalgic for previous iterations.

Beyond the characterization and vocal delivery, Zegler's on-screen presence feels somewhat ill-suited to the fairytale setting. There's a disconnect between her contemporary energy and the fantastical world the film attempts to create. This is not to say that modern actors cannot inhabit period roles, but in this instance, the fit feels forced, preventing the audience from fully immersing themselves in the story.

It's difficult to ignore the sense that the casting was driven by factors other than finding the best fit for the role. While representation is undoubtedly important, prioritizing it over the fundamental qualities of the character has unfortunately resulted in a central performance that actively detracts from the film's potential. This isn't a criticism of Zegler as an individual, but rather a critique of a casting decision that ultimately sabotaged the film.

The weaknesses in Zegler's portrayal ripple outwards, negatively impacting other aspects of the movie. The dynamic between Snow White and the dwarves feels less heartwarming and more transactional, lacking the genuine affection that should be at its core. The Evil Queen's motivations, while perhaps explored with more nuance, lose some of their impact when juxtaposed with a Snow White who doesn't evoke the same level of empathy and protectiveness from the audience. Even the visual spectacle of the film feels somewhat hollow when the central character fails to resonate.

Ultimately, ""Snow White 2025"" falters significantly due to the miscasting and underwhelming performance of Rachel Zegler. While other elements of the film may have their flaws, her portrayal of Snow White lacks the essential charm, vulnerability, and vocal magic needed to bring this beloved fairytale to life. This failure to connect with the audience on a fundamental level makes it difficult to invest in the story, leaving ""Snow White 2025"" as a poisoned apple in the realm of cinematic adaptations, a cautionary tale of prioritizing casting agendas over the intrinsic needs of the character and the story itself. The film's failure will likely be attributed, in no small part, to the central performance that simply couldn't capture the enduring magic of Snow White.",1/10,perhap dread depend perspect snow white unfortun land thud prove signific misstep studio numer factor contribut overal failur glare ultim damag aspect cast subsequ perform rachel zegler titular role instead fresh captiv take belov classic present snow white feel miscast lack essenti charm vulner defin charact ultim drag entir film outset zegler portray struggl captur inher innoc gentl spirit tradit associ snow white perform often come across assert even slightli defiant qualiti clash jarringli charact establish persona might argu modern take snow white chang feel less like empow updat like fundament misunderstand charact core essenc audienc struggl connect snow white radiat kind inher good make plight compel furthermor zegler vocal perform undoubtedli technic profici lack ether qualiti emot depth need icon song music number instead soar enchant often feel strain disconnect emot narr signific blow stori deepli root music heritag magic eman snow white voic simpli absent leav audienc feel underwhelm nostalg previou iter beyond character vocal deliveri zegler presenc feel somewhat fairytal set disconnect contemporari energi fantast world film attempt creat say modern actor inhabit period role instanc fit feel forc prevent audienc fulli immers stori difficult ignor sens cast driven factor find best fit role represent undoubtedli import priorit fundament qualiti charact unfortun result central perform activ detract film potenti critic zegler individu rather critiqu cast decis ultim sabotag film weak zegler portray rippl outward neg impact aspect movi dynam snow white dwarf feel less heartwarm transact lack genuin affect core evil queen motiv perhap explor nuanc lose impact juxtapos snow white evok level empathi protect audienc even visual spectacl film feel somewhat hollow central charact fail reson ultim snow white falter significantli due miscast underwhelm perform rachel zegler element film may flaw portray snow white lack essenti charm vulner vocal magic need bring belov fairytal life failur connect audienc fundament level make difficult invest stori leav snow white poison appl realm cinemat adapt cautionari tale priorit cast agenda intrins need charact stori film failur like attribut small part central perform simpli could captur endur magic snow white,-0.8063,0.094,0.113,0.793,Negative
"""Snow White"" fails to capture the magic of the original animated classic, opting instead for a hollow and uninspired retelling. The film's attempts at modernization feel forced and contrived, sacrificing the timeless charm of the source material for a series of lackluster clichés.

The performances are uniformly wooden, with even the most seasoned actors phoning it in. The dialogue is clunky and unnatural, often veering into cringe-worthy territory. The characters lack depth and complexity, reduced to mere archetypes devoid of any real personality.

Visually, the film is a mess. The CGI is distractingly poor, with the fantastical elements looking cheap and unconvincing. The costume design is equally uninspired, failing to create any sense of wonder or enchantment. The musical numbers are forgettable, lacking the iconic melodies that made the original film so beloved.

The plot is a meandering mess, lacking any sense of urgency or tension. The pacing is sluggish, with long stretches of dull exposition and tedious filler. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, eliciting more groans than laughs.

Overall, ""Snow White"" is a soulless and uninspired remake that fails to capture the magic of the original.

"Another poor remake with a B-grade cast trying desperately to make something of themselves. From the moment the film begins, it's apparent this is not the enchanting tale we all grew up loving. The magic, the charm, the warmth-none of it is present. Instead, what we're given is a hollow, uninspired reimagining that lacks soul, cohesion, and even basic cinematic appeal.

Let's start with the acting. At best, it's wooden; at worst, it's completely detached. The cast seems awkwardly thrown together, and not one performance manages to stand out in a meaningful way. The lead lacks the charisma and emotional depth to carry the weight of such an iconic character. There's no gravitas, no growth, and certainly no spark that would make her believable as the ""fairest of them all."" Supporting characters fare no better. Most feel like afterthoughts-poorly written and poorly portrayed. The chemistry between characters is non-existent, making it incredibly difficult to care about any of them or their fates.

The singing-another key component of any Disney musical-is underwhelming at best and jarring at worst. The original Snow White had unforgettable melodies that have endured for generations. In contrast, this remake offers forgettable and at times cringe-inducing musical numbers that feel shoehorned in rather than seamlessly woven into the narrative. Whether due to lackluster vocal performances, uninspired arrangements, or poor sound mixing, the musical moments consistently fall flat. Songs that should have elevated the emotion of a scene instead serve as distractions or unintentionally comedic breaks.

Visually, the film is also a disappointment. While Disney usually prides itself on delivering cinematic eye candy, this movie's CGI feels overdone and artificial. The enchanted forest lacks wonder, the animals lack personality, and the once-iconic imagery-like the Evil Queen's mirror or the dwarfs' cottage-feels generic and stripped of any visual identity. Even the costumes and set designs feel like low-budget approximations rather than thoughtfully crafted elements of a fantasy world.

Narratively, this remake tries too hard to be different and ends up losing the essence of what made the original beloved in the first place. In attempting to modernize the story, the filmmakers have abandoned the timeless qualities of love, kindness, and humility that defined Snow White. Instead, we're given a confused message that doesn't know whether it wants to be a fairy tale or a social commentary. It's possible to update a story for modern audiences while respecting its roots, but this film fails on both fronts. The pacing is also inconsistent-some scenes drag on with unnecessary dialogue, while others rush through important plot points with no emotional payoff.

Character development is sorely lacking. The Evil Queen, who should be a terrifying and iconic villain, comes off as flat and one-dimensional. Her motivations are murky, her presence barely menacing. Meanwhile, the dwarfs-once the heart and comic relief of the original-are reduced to mere caricatures, each lacking distinctive personalities or memorable moments.

It's also worth noting that the film's tone is all over the place. At times it feels like it's trying to be serious and grounded; at other times, it leans into goofy slapstick with no transition or consistency. This tonal confusion makes it hard to understand what kind of audience the film is even trying to appeal to.

All in all, this remake of Snow White is a misfire on almost every level. It lacks the magic, the heart, and the timeless charm that made the original a classic. Disney needs to seriously reconsider its strategy with these live-action adaptations. Nostalgia alone isn't enough.

"This version of Snow White is such a big letdown. I ignored the flood of bad reviews and decided against all odds to trust and verify. I truly cannot understand why such a beloved story was thrown into a meat grinder and twisted into a farce... and it wasn't even funny! Just tragic.

Rachel Ziegler certainly did not help at all with her interviews and outspoken manner that caused a huge online backash every time she spoke to the media.

"Like many other remakes, the question is why?

E.g. Why remake Mary Poppins, How to Train Your Dragon, Snow White, etc etc ?

Of course the reason is alway's money. A remake is an easy, low risk cash cow. (Or so Disney thought)

If they had stuck to the original story ,it could have been a success, with modern CGI and live action to recreate the classic.

Instead they decided to make changes, for no other reason, than because they could and that immediately jars (if you're fond of the original)

I digress

What's good about the film ?

Zegler can sing and does play the role competently .

Gal Gadot looks good (too good - see below)

Some of the music is nice.

What's not so good

Absurd when the mirror lies about who's the fairest of them, all. Gadot is miscast , they needed someone of Meryl Streep's age and acting ability for the roie.

Gadot lacks both acting and singing ability.

The film jumps about story wise (which ties in with having to re-edit after bad PR)

Where did the bandits come from ?

The Prince is really just a character who does pretty much nothing.

The Dwarves just looked weird and where are all the classic songs?

If this was the first time 'Snow White' was ever made , it would be 5/10, mediocre at best.

However it's a remake of a much beloved classic cartoon and cinematic history.

Instead of paying homage, to the much beloved original.

"Beautiful Reimagining of a Classic

The Snow White remake brings fresh life to a timeless fairytale with heart, style, and stunning visuals. While honoring the spirit of the 1937 original, this version dares to reimagine the story in a way that feels relevant, empowering, and emotionally engaging for a modern audience.

Visually, the film is a treat. From enchanting forest scenes to the Queen's darkly magical presence, every frame is rich with detail. The updated soundtrack is fantastic.

"I'm genuinely puzzled by the wave of negative reviews. As someone who recently revisited the original 'Snow White,' I found this adaptation to be a refreshing and compelling update, perfectly tailored for contemporary audiences. While I deeply respect the original's historical significance and nostalgic charm, its storytelling feels undeniably dated by today's standards.

This new take masterfully expands Snow White's character, providing her with a rich backstory, a meaningful character arc, and a more nuanced plot. Crucially, it achieves this without sacrificing the heart and soul of the original story. The iconic scenes, beloved characters, and classic songs are seamlessly integrated, creating a familiar yet revitalized experience.

Yes, the ending might have veered slightly into corniness and felt a tad drawn-out. However, these minor flaws didn't detract from my overall enjoyment. This film offers a fresh and engaging perspective on a timeless classic, demonstrating that it's possible to honor the past while embracing modern storytelling techniques.

"Disney should've learned from the completely abysmal live-action of The Lion King. Where the original animated version was full of life and emotion, the remake became nothing more than a nature documentary and a CGI. Playground. This film follows the same fate. The casting and acting was terrible. Both snow white and the queen lacked emotional range, and it felt like I was watching a table read of the script rather than an actual professional performance. The music is auto-tuned and stale, and fails to evoke emotion. The use of CGI for the dwarves (instead of actually casting smaller people) was cheesy and reminds you of a corny B-movie. I don't know how Marc Webb failed so miserably because Spiderman 1 and 500 Days were both amazing movies. Fun, funny, and the two romantic leads in those movies had crazy good chemistry. Like, really good. But he also did TASM2 and that was terrible. So, it's a hit and miss with him.

"Disney's Snow White remake is a disaster, but nothing drags it down more than Gal Gadot's atrocious performance as the Evil Queen. Once again proving that no amount of expensive PR can make up for a complete lack of acting talent, Gadot delivers her lines with the same lifeless, wooden expression she's had in every role she's ever played. There is no menace, no depth, no presence-just a painfully awkward attempt at being a villain that falls flat in every scene. It's clear she was cast not for her ability to embody the role but for her name recognition, and the result is an embarrassing, cringe-inducing performance that makes even the worst Disney villains look masterful in comparison. Every moment she's on screen is a reminder that Hollywood's obsession with forcing unqualified actors into major roles is ruining films, and Snow White suffers the most from this mistake.",1/10,disney snow white remak disast noth drag gal gadot atroci perform evil queen prove amount expens pr make complet lack act talent gadot deliv line lifeless wooden express everi role ever play menac depth pain awkward attempt villain fall flat everi scene clear cast abil embodi role name recognit result embarrass perform make even worst disney villain look master comparison everi moment screen remind hollywood obsess forc unqualifi actor major role ruin film snow white suffer mistak,-0.9808,0.074,0.342,0.584,Negative

"Zegler's portrayal of Snow White feels completely disconnected from what the character represents. Instead of breathing life into the role with warmth, kindness, and grace, we get a version of Snow White that's cold, unrelatable, and at times even dismissive of the source material. Her off-screen comments didn't help, but the real disappointment is that her performance feels phoned in, lacking the sincerity needed to carry such an iconic film.

Visually, the movie tries too hard to be modern and in doing so, strips away the fairy tale magic. The script is clunky, the pacing is awkward, and the decision to move away from the classic story beats makes it feel like Snow White in name only.

I actually thought it was fairly ok right before the dwarfs came on screen, right when Snow White traveled through the dark forest.

"3 things I hate about it: 1. Snow White dress: looks like a cheap knockoff or a cosplay, the sleeves, the white socks, the excessively bright colors, just looks awful.

2. The digital dwarfs: horrible design , looks out of place, they tried and failed.

3. The main cast: I think Rachel Ziegler is very talented, she can act and she can sing, but she definitely was miscasted for this role, she looks like a parody, talent is not enough when you are forcing into character. Gal Gadot is very limited with her acting resources. I agree she looks amazing, but this is above her skills.

3 things I liked: 1. The songs: I feel this being a musical works perfectly and the new songs were great additions.

2. The scenarios and ambient: the castle, the town, the woods, the cabin, I really liked all of that, it feels out of the original, very fairy tale, 3. The story: I don't get the hate, but the story works.

"The 2025 adaptation of ""Snow White"" takes significant liberties with the classic fairy tale, resulting in a film that feels both disconnected and contrived. Rachel Zegler, cast in the titular role, emerges as a controversial choice, not merely for her distinct divergence from the traditional Snow White image, but more so due to her publicly voiced disinterest in the original film and character. This lack of affinity with her character's heritage is palpable, casting a shadow over her performance and making it difficult for audiences to connect with her portrayal of a beloved fairy tale figure.

Compounding the film's issues is the casting of Gal Gadot as the envious Queen, which strikes as particularly jarring. Gadot, undeniably charismatic, overshadows Zegler in scenes they share, which fundamentally contradicts the narrative's premise of overwhelming jealousy based on beauty. This casting misstep not only undermines the story's credibility but also disrupts the viewer's suspension of disbelief. The film thus struggles under the weight of its own casting paradox, resembling more a tale of ""the emperor's new clothes"" where the audience is expected to ignore the evident miscasting for fear of broaching sensitive topics.

Overall, Disney's attempt to modernize ""Snow White"" and imbue it with contemporary themes misfires, resulting in a film that neither honors its source material nor succeeds in crafting a compelling new vision. The film, rather than offering a fresh take on an old classic, comes off as an uninspired, muddled attempt that lacks both heart and coherence.",1/10,adapt snow white take signific liberti classic fairi tale result film feel disconnect contriv rachel zegler cast titular role emerg controversi choic mere distinct diverg tradit snow white imag due publicli voic disinterest origin film charact lack affin charact heritag palpabl cast shadow perform make difficult audienc connect portray belov fairi tale figur compound film issu cast gal gadot enviou queen strike particularli jar gadot undeni charismat overshadow zegler scene share fundament contradict narr premis overwhelm jealousi base beauti cast misstep undermin stori credibl also disrupt viewer suspens disbelief film thu struggl weight cast paradox resembl tale emperor new cloth audienc expect ignor evid miscast fear broach sensit topic overal disney attempt modern snow white imbu contemporari theme misfir result film neither honor sourc materi succe craft compel new vision film rather offer fresh take old classic come uninspir muddl attempt lack heart coher,-0.8841,0.041,0.125,0.834,Negative
"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Not the first 20min or so which is almost okay, but the rest is unintentionally hilarious. I have not laughed this much in a long time at a movie.

A couple of little less negative things are that the first part of the movie is almost watchable. Mainly because it is decently true to the original. Zegler is not as bad as I thought, she can actually sing. And... uh... well, that is pretty much it.

Ignoring the Dwarfs for sanity reasons: Around the 30min mark or so this movie takes a very weird turn. Suddenly we are introduced to a bunch of characters (not the Dwarfs...) that will forever go down in history as the worst ever portrait on film. And from meeting those empty shells of characters it is all downhill.

Although Zegler is surprisingly not completely awful for most of the film, the rest of the cast are all so bad they make The Acolyte acting look masterful in comparison. The prince, whom is not a prince at all, just a robber and thief, he kisses snow like she has the plague, and Gadot is just Gadot trying to be... I dunno, some parody of an evil queen I guess.

This is about 50% true to the original, but the things they changed are so out there and so hilariously unpleasant I could not contain my laughter. This is so inapt and so badly done I cannot understand why Disney didn't shelf it or postponed it for 2 years to remake the whole thing. Someone actually approved this for the theatre. Wow. Disney... what are you doing?

I give this a 2/10 because the first 20min was almost okay and because Zegler was not as horrible as I thought she would be. But make no mistake, this is one of the worst movies you will ever see.

"The live-action Snow White remake disappoints, largely due to Rachel Zegler's lackluster portrayal of the iconic princess. Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and charm of the 1937 original, coming off as stiff and emotionally flat. Her attempt to modernize the character with an empowered edge feels forced and unnatural, while her singing, though technically strong, lacks soul and fails to elevate the forgettable new songs.

"The tale of Snow White lovingly updated and given new life after 88 years. Forget about the original for just a moment and try to see the movie through the eyes of a child. Snow White is beautifully re-imagined and is perfect for young children. An emotional journey with new songs as well as classics. A showcase for a battle between good and evil represented in a manner suitable for children. No parent wants to have a child burst into tears or leave the cinema white as a ghost. Disney and Disney theme parks are all about bringing joy to the children and adults who visit. This movie lives up to that special magic with uplifting songs and dance. Re telling the story for all, with happiness, with sadness and just a touch of darkness.

Went to see the movie with my 8 year old. We are huge disney fans and all i can say is that Walt Disney is turning over in his grave. Acting was horrible and story line made no sense. If you want to make new movies then spend the time on a good story dont just remake a classic movie and create a story line that you think fits in 2025. The music and singing was good but acting felt like something out of a low budget hallmark movie. The scenery went from an enchanted forest to a regular forest. For as kich money Disney has and te amount of true talent out there they really dropped the ball.

"Snow White is wonderful fairy tale we all grew up with. This 2025 version falls quite short of the mark and the memories.

"Disney's 2025 Snow White is a baffling misfire-an uninspired, joyless attempt to modernize a classic that neither respects the original nor offers anything fresh. Despite boasting a talented cast and a massive budget, the film is a soulless spectacle weighed down by poor writing, awkward performances, and uninspired visuals. One of the film's biggest failures is its attempt to ""update"" Snow White by stripping away the very elements that made it a timeless fairy tale. Instead of a heartfelt story about kindness, resilience, and magic, we get a protagonist who lacks charm and a narrative that feels cobbled together from corporate boardroom decisions.

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is a disappointing, unnecessary remake that strips away the charm of the original in favour of a bland, lifeless modernisation. While the film attempts to update the classic tale with a more ""empowered"" Snow White, the result feels forced, uninspired, and ultimately hollow.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is underwhelming. Rather than embodying the warmth and kindness that made the original character so beloved, she comes across as disengaged and unremarkable. Her line delivery lacks depth, making it difficult to connect with her version of the character. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen had potential, but the film fails to make her truly menacing or memorable. Instead, her performance is reduced to exaggerated expressions and weak writing.

Visually, the movie is a disaster. The CGI is particularly bad, especially when it comes to the seven dwarfs (or the awkward replacements for them). The overuse of digital effects makes everything feel artificial, lacking the organic magic of classic Disney animation or even previous live-action adaptations like Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast. Instead of feeling enchanted, I was distracted by how oddly animated and unrealistic everything looked.

The narrative itself is muddled. Disney clearly wanted to move away from the traditional fairy-tale romance, but in doing so, they created a story that lacks emotional depth. The attempts at modern empowerment feel like a checklist rather than meaningful character development. Snow White no longer dreams of love, but she also doesn't seem to have a compelling alternative goal. It's as if the film is more focused on rejecting the past than telling a strong new story.

Even the music fails to leave an impression. The new songs are forgettable, and the absence of iconic classics like Someday My Prince Will Come only makes the film feel more disconnected from its roots.

Overall, Snow White is a soulless cash grab, proving once again that not every classic needs a remake. Instead of adding something new, it takes away everything that made the original special.",1/10,disney snow white disappoint unnecessari remak strip away charm origin favour bland lifeless modernis film attempt updat classic tale empow snow white result feel forc uninspir ultim hollow rachel zegler perform snow white underwhelm rather embodi warmth kind made origin charact belov come across disengag unremark line deliveri lack depth make difficult connect version charact gal gadot evil queen potenti film fail make truli menac memor instead perform reduc exagger express weak write visual movi disast cgi particularli bad especi come seven dwarf awkward replac overus digit effect make everyth feel artifici lack organ magic classic disney anim even previou adapt like cinderella beauti beast instead feel enchant distract oddli anim unrealist everyth look narr muddl disney clearli want move away tradit romanc creat stori lack emot depth attempt modern empower feel like checklist rather meaning charact develop snow white longer dream love also seem compel altern goal film focus reject past tell strong new stori even music fail leav impress new song forgett absenc icon classic like someday princ come make film feel disconnect root overal snow white soulless cash grab prove everi classic need remak instead ad someth new take away everyth made origin special,-0.128,0.148,0.15,0.703,Negative
"Dear Lord.

This film is a soulless, joyless husk of what was once a beloved animated masterpiece. Stripped of all magic and wonder, this film trudges along with all the grace of a corporate spreadsheet-lifeless, uninspired, and designed solely to squeeze more money out of nostalgic audiences while completely disregarding what made the original special.

Let's start with the CGI dwarves, which are nothing short of an abomination. Instead of casting talented little-person actors to bring these iconic characters to life, Disney bowed to the ridiculous and hypocritical opinions of Peter Dinklage, who somehow decided that hiring little people for these roles (the same kinds of roles that have made him rich) is offensive. The result? Awful, weightless CGI creatures that look like they crawled out of a cutscene from a bad 2010s video game.

But of course, what did we expect? This is yet another of Disney's soulless cash grabs, in which they strip-mine their own classics and reduce them to uninspired, pandering disasters. Rather than creating new, compelling stories, they keep regurgitating beloved films, gutting them of heart and sincerity in the process.

And let's not even get started on how this film completely spits in the face of its audience. It takes a timeless fairy tale and mangles it into an ugly, modern, feminist lecture, force-feeding us a misguided and graceless revision of masculinity and femininity. Gone are the classic themes of love, virtue, and kindness, replaced by a clumsy, heavy-handed attempt at empowerment that lacks any charm or authenticity.

Finally, the casting is just laughable. We're seriously expected to believe that Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is jealous of the beauty of Rachel Zegler's Snow White? That's not just a stretch-it's outright comedy. It completely undermines one of the most fundamental aspects of the story. If the audience is too busy laughing at the absurdity of the premise, how are we supposed to be invested in the narrative?

At the end of the day, this film is just another example of Disney's creative bankruptcy. It disrespects its source material, alienates its audience, and fails in every way to justify its own existence.

"I usually try to find something redeemable in every film I watch, but with Snow White (2025), that task proved nearly impossible. This film is a complete misfire, both in terms of storytelling and execution, and honestly, I'm still wondering how it even got greenlit in its current form.

Let's start with the obvious: this is not Snow White. It's a hollow reimagining that strips away everything that made the original timeless. Gone is the heartwarming charm, the sense of wonder, and the emotional core. What we're left with is a preachy, politically charged narrative that seems more focused on pushing an agenda than telling a compelling story.

The lead performance lacks charisma and warmth. Snow White, once a symbol of kindness and innocence, is now cold, defiant, and unrelatable. While reinterpreting characters can work when done with care, here it feels forced and out of sync with the tone of the story. Supporting characters - including the dwarfs (sorry, ""magical companions"") - are either underdeveloped or completely unnecessary. The chemistry between characters is nonexistent, and many scenes drag without purpose.

Visually, the film is uninspired. The CGI looks cheap at times, and the costume design feels like it was ripped from a high school theater production. Even the forest - usually a place of magic and mystery - feels sterile and lifeless.

I'm all for updating classics and making them resonate with new generations, but it has to be done with respect and care. This version of Snow White feels like it was written by committee, afraid to commit to a clear vision and desperate to tick all the ""modernization"" boxes.

Disney has proven it can make successful live-action remakes (Cinderella, The Jungle Book), but this isn't one of them. It's not even close. If you're a fan of the original, I strongly advise skipping this one. It will only leave you frustrated, disappointed, and wondering why some stories can't just be left alone.",1/10,usual tri find someth redeem everi film watch snow white task prove nearli imposs film complet misfir term storytel execut honestli still wonder even got greenlit current form let start obviou snow white hollow reimagin strip away everyth made origin timeless gone heartwarm charm sens wonder emot core left preachi polit charg narr seem focus push agenda tell compel stori lead perform lack charisma warmth snow white symbol kind innoc cold defiant unrelat reinterpret charact work done care feel forc sync tone stori support charact includ dwarf sorri magic companion either underdevelop complet unnecessari chemistri charact nonexist mani scene drag without purpos visual film uninspir cgi look cheap time costum design feel like rip high school theater product even forest usual place magic mysteri feel steril lifeless updat classic make reson new gener done respect care version snow white feel like written committe afraid commit clear vision desper tick modern box disney proven make success remak cinderella jungl book one even close fan origin strongli advis skip one leav frustrat disappoint wonder stori ca left alon,0.9823,0.19,0.043,0.767,Positive

"Ah yes, Snow White (2025)-a film that bravely asks, ""What if we took a timeless classic and made it aggressively unlikable?"" My personal favorite part? When Snow White girlbossed the dwarfs into doing chores for her. In the original, she lovingly said, ""And I will use the broom."" But in this one? Nope. It's ""And HE will use the broom."" Nothing says empowerment like delegating housework to a group of hardworking men who were minding their own business. Truly inspiring.

But wait-why stop at ruining the dwarfs when you can also add seven completely pointless bandits? That's right, we got dwarfs AND bandits, and yet somehow, the film had double the characters and half the charm. These bandits were about as necessary as a glass slipper at a marathon. Seriously, why were they there? What was their purpose? Did they get lost on their way to a Robin Hood audition?

I physically walked out of this movie. Not metaphorically, not emotionally-I stood up and left. And honestly? I think even the Prince wanted out.

Rachel Zegler: ""I don't need a Prince to save me."" The Prince: ""Good, because I'm actually here for your stepmother.""

Bro really pulled a ""that's not my problem"" and dipped. Iconic.

And can we please stop pretending that bad writing is excusable because ""it's for kids""? Children deserve good movies, not whatever this was. If you genuinely believe kids are too dumb to appreciate quality storytelling, I'd love to introduce you to Pixar, Harry Potter, and literally any Studio Ghibli film.

"This movie is an absolute abomination. They butchered a classic! The acting is atrocious, the story is unrecognizable, and the whole thing is just... awful. A complete waste of time and money. Avoid at all costs! They should be ashamed. This isn't Snow White, it's a joke.

As someone who appreciates cinema in its various forms, I went into this new Snow White with an open mind, hoping for a fresh perspective or at least a competent execution of a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film is a profound disappointment on a technical and narrative level.

The direction lacks any discernible vision. The pacing is erratic, lurching from scene to scene without a clear sense of rhythm or purpose. The framing often feels amateurish, with compositions that lack visual interest or thematic resonance. There's a distinct lack of cinematic artistry on display.

The performances are uniformly uninspired. The lead actress, while perhaps given a specific direction, fails to convey any emotional depth or nuance. Her portrayal feels one-note and lacks the necessary complexity to carry the weight of the character. Supporting performances are equally flat and unmemorable.

From a narrative standpoint, the screenplay is a jumbled mess. The attempts at subverting expectations feel forced and lack the necessary groundwork to be truly impactful. The thematic explorations are shallow and underdeveloped, failing to offer any meaningful insights or fresh perspectives on the classic tale. The plot points feel contrived and the overall structure is disjointed.

The visual effects, while present, often feel unintegrated and distract from the storytelling rather than enhancing it. There's a lack of cohesion in the visual style, making the film feel disjointed and lacking a strong aesthetic identity.

Ultimately, this film fails not just as an adaptation, but as a piece of cinema in its own right. It lacks the fundamental elements of good filmmaking: compelling performances, a coherent narrative, and a strong visual language.

"Disney has officially lost the plot. This abomination of a film is not just bad-it's an insult to storytelling, filmmaking, and anyone who grew up loving the original Snow White. I sat through nearly two hours of this disaster, hoping it would redeem itself, but no. It only got worse.

"One of the most loved and revered movies being remade with integral parts destroyed in the narrative because the writer/diector and actors do not understand what it stood for and the story behind it.

Snow White is a story of the victory of good vs Evil, of love and virtue... not ego 'winning' evil, breaking of family for the power of self (which is no power at all but a severe social disability).

I truly hope it is a major flop but I guess there are enough people curious and enough indoctrination of the youth through marketing to make it profitable.despite the drivel it is.

It is such a disaster in not reading the room that they had to redo the dwarfs because they in their infinite madness thought it was rude to cast dwarfs in a movie called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (not Snow White and the Seven Samurai which is another story completely written by Tom Holt and not Grimm).

"Rachel Zegler is obnoxious and gal gadot is a genocidal psychopath.

Where do I even begin with Snow White (2025)? This film is a perfect storm of everything wrong with modern Hollywood: tone-deaf casting, insufferable performances, and a story so mangled it makes the original fairy tale seem like Shakespeare.

Let's start with Rachel Zegler as Snow White. Her portrayal is nothing short of obnoxious. Instead of the graceful, kind-hearted princess we all know, Zegler delivers a smug, self-righteous performance that makes you root for the Evil Queen. Her line delivery is grating, and her attempts at humor fall flatter than a pancake. It's clear she's trying way too hard to be ""relatable"" and ""modern,"" but it just comes off as cringe-worthy.

And then there's Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. If Zegler is obnoxious, Gadot is downright unwatchable. Her performance is so wooden and lifeless, it's like she's reading her lines off a cue card for the first time. The character is supposed to be menacing and cunning, but Gadot's portrayal is more like a bored Instagram influencer trying to act evil. It's laughable, but not in a good way.

The script is a disaster. Instead of embracing the timeless charm of the original story, the writers decided to inject it with a heavy-handed political agenda that feels forced and unnecessary. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is all over the place, and the attempts at ""modernizing"" the story are so ham-fisted, they'll leave you rolling your eyes.

The visuals are equally disappointing. The CGI is so overdone it looks like a video game cutscene from 2010. The dwarfs, who are now inexplicably replaced by a group of ""magical creatures,"" are forgettable and uninspired. The film tries to be visually stunning, but it ends up looking like a cheap knockoff of *Into the Woods*.

In short, *Snow White (2025)* is a dumpster fire of a movie. It's a perfect example of how not to adapt a classic fairy tale. Rachel Zegler's obnoxious performance and Gal Gadot's lifeless acting are just the tip of the iceberg.

"Once upon a time, Disney was the keeper of dreams-the studio that brought fairy tales to life with magic, wonder, and heart. But they shattered one of their most cherished legacies. Snow White is not a reimagining; it is a betrayal.

This is not Snow White. Not even close. They have taken a story that has enchanted generations and ripped its soul apart. The timeless tale of beauty, kindness, and resilience against evil has been twisted into something unrecognizable.

The heart of the legend-the very essence of what made Snow White endure for over a century-is missing. And what remains is an empty shell, a film that wears the name Snow White but has nothing of her spirit.

What made Snow White special? It wasn't just the poisoned apple, the Evil Queen, or the seven dwarfs. It was the fairytale magic. It was the ''pure-hearted girl who won hearts through her kindness'', not arrogance. It was the contrast between innocence and vanity, between good and evil. But this film has no reverence for its own source material.

Instead, it tears apart its own foundation, rewriting history and distorting what made Snow White an icon in the first place.

They didn't adapt Snow White - they erased her. The filmmakers didn't care about preserving the legend. They cared about turning it into something else entirely and slapping the name ''Snow White'' on it. If they wanted to tell a different story, fine-then call it something else! But don't take a beloved classic and distort it beyond recognition.

The Evil Queen is supposed to be ''terrifying''. A chilling embodiment of vanity, envy, and obsession. But here? Stripped of her operatic grandeur, reduced to something utterly forgettable. Where is the ''menace''? Where is the deliciously dark presence that made the original Queen one of Disney's greatest villains?

And the seven dwarfs? Well, if you've seen the discussions, you already know how that went.

This is what stings the most: Snow White is a foundational story. It was the film that made Disney what it is today - the very first animated feature, a cinematic revolution, a legacy passed down through generations. To discard that history so carelessly, to treat it as if it needs fixing when it was never broken to begin with... it's heartbreaking.

Disney has always reinvented fairy tales, but they've never erased their souls before.

This time, they have. They have taken one of their most sacred stories and destroyed its identity.

You want to make a new fantasy film? Great. You want a new heroine, a new world, a new take? Go for it. But don't pretend this is Snow White when it clearly isn't.

Call it ''The Forest Princess''. Call it ''The Magic Mirror''. Call it literally anything else. But don't call it ''Snow White'' - because this isn't her story.

This is not magic.

This is not wonder.

"We took my niece and nephew to see it this afternoon. It wasn't on my radar, but the kids who are 6 and 7 wanted to go. I saw the original probably 59 years ago but remembered it as being a fun story with a sweet ending. This was anything but.... The kids who normally sit mesmerized watching Disney movies were pretty disinterested after about 3 or 4 minutes and we had to keep trying to get them to stop chatting and watch the movie. After giving up on that, we just watched it with the kids perking up during the singing numbers, and then they went back to chatting. I have to say that this was a pretty bad movie overall. By the end of the movie it left us not caring about any of the characters, the story was just pointless and terrible, and the CGI characters were more like monsters to the kids than dwarfs. The magical creatures people were talking about in line were also pointless. Gal did the best with the wooden lines she was given, and Snow White was just a weird character herself. It was probably the worst written show to come out of Disney ever, so hopefully they will redeem themselves with a brand new idea!

"This new take on the classic German fairy tale by the house of mouse is truly a 'Graus' - which means ghastliness / horror / abomination in German. See what I did there?

Joking aside, we all knew from the trailer and word of mouth that this was going to be bad. But even bad movies can be enjoyed if they're just incompetent enough to be unintentionally entertaining.

Unfortunately, Snow White is'nt so-bad-it's-good either, because it lacks ambition. It doesn't aim high and miss, it aims... nowhere.

Snow White is a poster child for the common complaint from cinephiles about how ugly modern digital movies look. It's not hard to see why. Everything is shot in front of a blue screen. When you watch older movies, even failed fantasy efforts like Willow, they still look beautiful. There are shadows, contrasts, scene composition. Snow White, like many modern Disney films, looks dark and muddy. The characters hardly stand out from the background, there are no hard shadows, no bright highlights. Scenes shot in sunlight look darker than my living room.

Why is that?

Well if you compose your scene digitally, you limit yourself if you shoot your actors with hard shadows. So they shoot everything flat. And then add it into a flat scene.

The result being, that everything looks flat, boring and uncinematic.

In addition, the pacing is uneven. Kids will be bored to tears by the slow pace and lack of action and of course the socialist lectures.

People joked about this film being a DEI fest, but it's even worse than imagined. Snow White is no longer a princess, she's a feminist anti-patriarchal social justice warrior pushing for equity - through apple pies.

No, I'm not joking. More than half the movie is her giving social justice lectures about pies which amount to ""those who have more should share"". That's it, that's the message.

Rachel Zegler lacks charisma and charm, but has a decent singing voice.

Gal Gadot absolutely hams it up and is cartoonishly evil in all her scenes. While I never saw her as a great actress, every now and then she delivers a surprisingly good performance, similar to the first Wonder Woman movie. She's hits the perfect tone, and is fun to watch. Maybe it's because she is the only actor who's performance doesn't fall under bland.

Unfortunately, it's not enough to enjoy the movie.

This is by far the worst of the terrible Disney live action remakes.

"In a stunning display of cinematic ineptitude, the 2025 remake of Snow White proves that not every classic fairy tale deserves a modern reimagining. This film is less a magical journey and more a painful exercise in how to completely butcher a beloved story.

The screenplay reads like it was written by a committee of disinterested marketing executives who once heard someone describe Snow White in passing. Our titular character, played with all the charisma of a department store mannequin, stumbles through a plot so convoluted that even the seven dwarfs would struggle to make sense of it.

The visual effects are a catastrophe that would make even low-budget YouTube creators cringe. The enchanted forest looks like it was constructed using a combination of stock footage and a toddler's finger paintings. The evil queen's transformation scenes are so poorly executed that they appear to have been rendered on a smartphone from 2010.

Dialogue reaches new heights of cringe-worthiness, with lines so wooden they could be used as lumber in home construction. Characters deliver exposition with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. Every potentially interesting moment is crushed under the weight of unnecessary plot twists and painfully forced attempts at ""modernizing"" the classic tale.

The musical numbers - if one can even call them that - sound like they were composed during a particularly uninspired karaoke night. Auto-tune is weaponized to such an extent that it becomes a form of auditory assault.

Perhaps the most offensive aspect of this film is how it manages to strip away every ounce of magic from a story that has enchanted generations. This isn't a reimagining; it's a total dismemberment of a classic fairy tale.

"Not the worst Disney remake (Mulan and Pinocchio are worse) but still very bad.

The visuals give off that overproduced Hollywood feel lacking the artistry and magic of the original. The plot is just all over the place and doesn't know whether it wants to be it's own thing or wants to follow the original.

Zegler was decent and her singing was one of the only bright spots in the film, but Gadot gave one of the worst villain performances I have ever seen and probably the worst I have seen from her which is saying a lot considering she's a bad actress. Old songs were fine but New songs were all bland. The new characters were all underdeveloped and except Jonathan, the new love interest they didn't contribute much to the story. And the dwarves just looked plain bad.

Overall, a dull, bland, boring, lifeless film with very little redeeming qualities and a representation of everything wrong with the Hollywood of today and a desecration of Disney's legacy. As a former Disney fan and fan of the original, this movie is just heartbreaking to me and shows how far the company has fallen on recent years.

The CGI-heavy visuals, especially the uncanny animated dwarfs, look cheap and uninspired, draining the enchanted world of wonder.

I grew up with the classics, and I can admit how unfair and cruel they were to only feature girls with my skin color. There is nothing wrong with changing that in a character, when in the past it was very disproportionate. We have to change the present of how girls and women are represented on screen to move forward into the future. There is no excuse for those rating this 1 star just because of their hatred. The theater I was in was packed with children, and every single one of them loved Rachel as Snow White. That is technically the target audience for this, not the hateful adults choosing to rate a movie they may have not even seen to begin with. That all said, the singing talent was there, the portrayal was on point, and the direction of having her be a strong female character who also can be in love was wonderfully refreshing. The only down side was Gal Gadot's singing, but even that doesn't warrant a 1 star rating. Seriously shame on those who did that.

"My honest thoughts on Snow White and just to clarify, Disney hasn't paid me to write something nice.

Disney's live-action remake of Snow White has been one of the most talked-about-and often unjustly maligned-films online. Despite the polarised critics and the relentless hate campaign, I firmly believe this film is pure Disney magic.

What truly stood out was how the story was adjusted for a slightly modern take. The film not only answers lingering questions about Snow White's skin color and the origin of her name but does so with a refreshing narrative twist that feels both authentic and engaging.

Rachel Zegglar delivers a brilliant performance that perfectly captures the quintessential Disney voice. She brings a captivating charm to the role, embodying the magic and wonder that the character deserves.

One of the main concerns leading up to the film was the CGI portrayal of the dwarfs. I was pleasantly surprised-these digital characters were executed flawlessly, preserving the charm of their animated counterparts. Their scenes in the diamond mine, in particular, looked stunning on screen, and I couldn't imagine them being any better served by human actors.

The musical numbers hit many high notes as well. I loved the classic ""Hi Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work,"" and the new song ""Wishing on a Wish"" was nicely done. While not every song hit the mark, the soundtrack overall enriched the fairytale atmosphere of the film.

Gal Gadot's performance, while occasionally a bit over-the-top, ultimately worked well-especially in her portrayal of the old witch with the poison apple. Even though some moments felt slightly exaggerated, her energy added an interesting dynamic to the film.

Compared to other live-action remakes like Wicked, which certainly had its moments, this version of Snow White stands out as my favorite Disney live-action adaptation so far. It exudes a pure fairytale feel that pays homage to the original animation while embracing a modern sensibility. The film might not have the grand scale of Wicked, but its charm, humor, and heart make it a delightful experience. The kids in the cinema laughed at key moments and all seemed be saying they enjoyed it leaving the cinema. My grandson, Charlie, loved it.

I wholeheartedly recommend taking your kids to see it. They'll love it, and so will you.

"First, I am not sure why Disney can't make more original movies instead of the endless remakes. It shows where we are at today, totally devoid of any creativeness.

I wanted to give everyone the compare the actual original story of Snow White. Especially the ending.

In the Grimm's book, the queen made one apple, but it was only PARTIALLY poisoned, the red side, the white side was fine and the queen offered Snow White the red side while eating herself the white side. When Snow White died, the Queen went back to the castle and asked the ""Looking-glass against the wall, Who is fairest of us all?"" at last it answered, ""You are the fairest now of all.""

After the dwarfs found Snow White dead they made a glass coffin for her and sat her on the mountain hill where one day the Prince rode by and offered to by her, but they first refused, until he promised to take care of her and them so the finally agreed to bring the coffin to the Castle, but on the way ""they stumbled over a bush, and with the shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat. It was not long before she opened her eyes, threw up the cover of the coffin, and sat up, alive and well.""

While the prince and Snow White got married the Queen asked the looking-glass answered, ""O Queen, although you are of beauty rare, The young bride is a thousand times more fair."" The queen railed and cursed, and was beside herself with disappointment and anger. The queen felt she should have ""no peace until she went and saw the bride. And when she saw her she knew her for Snow-white, and could not stir from the place for anger and terror. For they had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell down dead.""

So the queen didn't die until AFTER the wedding. Back to this new monstrosity version.

The cast was totally miscast, from Gal being way too beautiful compared to Rachel playing Snow White. It was almost laughable the stark contrast it was. The whole point of the original Snow White is the Queen was jealous of Snow White's beauty.

The original Snow White, she was a kind, selfless person that enjoyed cleaning for the 7 dwarfs, but the new one she went straight to sleep. Is cleaning and cooking that offensive these days?

Then, the atrocious looking CGI garden gnomes of the 7 dwarfs, cause apparently it was offensive to hire actual dwarfs. This is PC running amok. And unlike the original Disney characters who were distinctly different, here they all kinda looked the same.

And a lot of the important, cute exposition form the original is missing, like when Snow White comments on the names of the dwarfs after she cleans, the new one she just goes to sleep right away, like she is entitled to sleep there, compared to the original where she verbalized that IF she cleaned their place they may let her stay, in there words, she wanted to do a good deed in hopes of getting something in exchange.

I decided to take my kids with me seeing as it's a Disney movie and they love it. I wasn't sure if they or I would like because of the hate going around. I've grew up in the 90s with all original classics so this was big for me. I took a chance and went with it since my kids wanted me to go see with them. I kid you not during the first 30 minutes my kids wanted to leave. And mind you they are 7 to 12 years old. I find the messages there a bit to raunchy for kids movie. And not much action just talking throughout the first 30 mins. I got them to go with my wife I finished the movie and probably I would say the worst movie of Disney I've ever seen. The music choice was overbearing. The visuals were phenomenon but doesn't match with what's going on. It fell flat around the hour. Got some good moments and laughs but that's it. Please don't wast your time on this movie. I regret paying over 80 dollars that day.

"I genuinely tried to watch Snow White objectively-open-minded, no nostalgia goggles, just a clean slate. And I was honestly shocked by how bad this movie was.

The pacing is awkward, the plot feels paper-thin, and the characters are so underdeveloped it's almost insulting. Snow White herself is less of a protagonist and more of a decorative object being moved around the story with zero agency. It's hard to root for someone who barely seems aware of what's happening around her.

The humor doesn't land, the dialogue is painfully simplistic, and the dwarfs-while iconic in name-are just cartoonish stereotypes with no real depth. I understand this was a product of its time, but that doesn't excuse how flat and dull everything feels. Even the villain, who should be a highlight, is reduced to melodramatic overacting and weak motivations.

Visually, it's dated-which is expected-but even so, the animation doesn't hold up in a way that compensates for the movie's many flaws. I wasn't expecting Pixar-level polish, but I was hoping for at least some sense of magic or charm. Instead, it felt like a chore to get through.

If this is considered a classic, it's only because of historical significance-not quality. Snow White is, unfortunately, a relic that hasn't aged well, and watching it today only highlights how far storytelling and animation have come. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who values plot, character development, or emotional depth.",1/10,genuin tri watch snow white nostalgia goggl clean slate honestli shock bad movi pace awkward plot feel charact underdevelop almost insult snow white less protagonist decor object move around stori zero agenc hard root someon bare seem awar happen around humor land dialogu pain simplist icon cartoonish stereotyp real depth understand product time excus flat dull everyth feel even villain highlight reduc melodramat overact weak motiv visual even anim hold way compens movi mani flaw expect polish hope least sens magic charm instead felt like chore get consid classic histor qualiti snow white unfortun relic age well watch today highlight far storytel anim come would recommend anyon valu plot charact develop emot depth,-0.5118,0.157,0.173,0.669,Negative

"This movie is another great example of Disney's recent tear of destroying everything we love for no reason. This movie truly holds up to the ""if it aint broke, dont try to fix it"" statement.

Without spoiling too much (you will spoil your day watching this but still...) the movie is extremely dull, bland and poorly executed making you wonder why you even gave it a shot.

Also the fact that they decided to go with so much CGI for the dwarfs and forest shows to me how inpersonal and lazy they have been with the huge amounts of money they have for making movies nowadays into consideration, feeling like your watching a movie playout in a themepark.

On top of that bad omen, the movie is unfortunately one remake too many. The actors' performance is subpar at best. It does not have the spirit of the story. I don't mind remakes, some movies with a great plot and storyline were butchered by the filmmaking itself, and would deserve a remake. However, here, this is not the case.

"I just watched the movie, and wow, I absolutely loved it. Maybe even the best live-action Disney film ever. It captured something truly magical-the kind of wonder and heart that made the original so special, while adding its own unique charm. The visuals were stunning, the performances were heartfelt, and the music was absolutely enchanting.

What frustrates me the most is that this film was torn apart before it even had a chance! People judged it before seeing it, without giving it the opportunity to shine. But it does shine-brightly! It's a film full of joy, adventure, and pure Disney magic.

This is a movie I wholeheartedly wish upon the world, and I hope that one day it will find a well-deserved place on Broadway. It has everything a great musical needs-memorable songs, lovable characters, and a story that touches the heart. The stage would be the perfect home for this incredible tale.

And let's talk about Dopey-he is, without a doubt, the star of the show! His charm, humor, and warmth stole every scene, and I couldn't help but fall in love with his character all over again.

If you're on the fence about watching this film, I urge you to give it a chance.

now that would be truly epic.

As for this movie.

I know this review will get thumbs down .. but hey it's fine with me i'm not rolling with the hate train, half the people putting reviews here didn't even watched the movie and just go with the hate train.

Is this movie a 10\10 ? No... it's flat. The acting is flat, the cgi dwarfs are wierd, it's borig at times, and it's not as good as it could have been .

Is it a 1/10 movie ? Absulotely not.

Rachel has good stuff and bad stuff to her bad: -she is a not a good person OUTSIDE of the camera, she bad mouth Gal, the movie, and disney which effects how much you can love her as snow white -her acting is flat good: -she has a great voice -i personaly think she looks good, i know many think she's ugly but i dont see it i think she looks great.

-she is decent actor. Not good but decent.

Gal also has bad and good to her bad: -she cannot sing, her songs were autotune a lot.

-her acting is very flat as the evil queen it's not her best role.

Good: -she is drop dead beautiful -again her acting is decent it's not bad.

Yea they could do a lot more with Lana Parila (the one that playd the evil queen in once upon a time) and with Jenna Ortega (wensday from the adams family 'wensday' series on netflix) as snow white.

They could add some comedy to the evil queen not kept it so boring

add some nice creativity to the story, scenes, songs, have better director for the songs

they could have talked to the fans..... disney never talks to the fans..

they could have made this a 12/10 movie instead they made this

"A princess joins forces with seven dwarfs to liberate her kingdom from her cruel stepmother the Evil Queen. A live-action adaptation of the 1937 Disney animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".

I wanted to give this a chance mostly because I love Gal Gadot. But, if you have a live action film, you can't colour it as if it was a cartoon. That's a hybrid film and has proven not to work, and it doesn't work here.

Also, they aren't dwarves. I don't know what they are but they aren't dwarfs.

Emilia Faucher who plays the young Snow White put in the best performance of any of the cast. That fact is shameful.

The magic mirror's voice, is that from the 60's?

And Gal Gadot has acted much better in the past. I don't know whether it was stresses with Zegler or simply a poor director but Gal was definitely not on form in this film.

And Zegler...well...she is literally playing a person who wants to impress on the screen. She's not playing a part of Snow White, she is very clearly trying to play anyway she can that she thinks will make her look good on screen. We've all seen it before but not in one so young. Also, just a quick reminder from the story of Snow White, ""Soon after that, the kind queen got her wish when she gave birth to a baby girl who had skin white as snow, lips red as blood, and hair black as ebony. They named the baby princess Snow White, but sadly, the queen died after giving birth to Snow White."" Now the American born and raised Zegler states that she identifies as latino due to some Colombian ancestor, and the fact that she clearly is not white in colour or culture. She is a DEI hire and we all know it, and we all dislike it because it shames the original story.

"Not sure why this got 2 stars. It is certainly not as bad as all that. The casting choice of Snow White was perfect. She perfectly embodies the Snow White persona. Innocent, charming, strong. The movie talks about how she was born during a snow storm and that is why she is named Snow White. She still has the short black hair and the yellow, blue and red dress so everyone can chill out.

They changed a few of the songs, which is a little bit of a disappointment, but I guess the old songs are a little dated with a girl waiting for her prince to come and save her. The movie flips that narrative and Snow White actually has to save the guy, who isn't even a prince, but a rebel against the queen.

Gal Gadot is fabulous in her Snow Queen dress and jewels. She does give off evil, which I love since she so often plays the heroine. Mirror needs to have his eyes checked bc the queen is definitely the fairest in the land with those stunning looks. But I think the mirror is looking at inner beauty too. Also the play on words that the queen may be fair in beauty, but she certainly is not fair to the people.

"A princess joins forces with seven dwarfs to liberate her kingdom from her cruel stepmother the Evil Queen. A live-action adaptation of the 1937 Disney animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".

I wanted to give this a chance mostly because I love Gal Gadot. But, if you have a live action film, you can't colour it as if it was a cartoon. That's a hybrid film and has proven not to work, and it doesn't work here.

Also, they aren't dwarves. I don't know what they are but they aren't dwarfs.

Emilia Faucher who plays the young Snow White put in the best performance of any of the cast. That fact is shameful.

The magic mirror's voice, is that from the 60's?

And Gal Gadot has acted much better in the past. I don't know whether it was stresses with Zegler or simply a poor director but Gal was definitely not on form in this film.

And Zegler...well...she is literally playing a person who wants to impress on the screen. She's not playing a part of Snow White, she is very clearly trying to play anyway she can that she thinks will make her look good on screen. We've all seen it before but not in one so young.

That said, I tried to be objective about the film and no matter what you think of any of the people in their personal lives, the film is a poor remake, and takes the shine from the original because of it.

Gone is the timeless fairy tale magic, replaced with a forced and preachy narrative that feels more like a checklist of modern studio mandates than a genuine attempt to tell a great story.

"Disney's live-action Snow White remake is a misguided attempt at modernizing a classic that ultimately strips away the charm of the original. It suffers from a weak script, uninspired performances, and a lack of the magic that made the 1937 classic so beloved.

The biggest issue lies in its reimagining of the characters and story. The attempt to update Snow White's character feels forced, and the absence of key elements such as the iconic dwarfs only makes it worse. The villain lacks the menacing presence of the animated Evil Queen, making the conflict feel dull and uninspired.

"Oh Disney. Yet another lack lustre reboot of one of your all time classics. I am not entirely sure how you managed to rip the soul of this more than you did the Little Mermaid. It's quite bizarre how you could have miscast this so badly. No chemistry between any of the leads. The story was mediocre at best and the attempts at humour fell extremely flat. So many continuity issues to mention as well.

The only 2 parts of the movie I truly enjoyed were 'Hi Ho' because I really did rather like the animated Dwarves, especially Dopey who I think was truly adorable. And 'Whistle while you work' was equally sweet and did have a smidge of that ol' Disney magic. But all of the new songs were instantly forgettable though. And Gal Gadot was not the evil queen we deserved. I had secretly hoped that Lana Parilla would be typecast into her role... because really, who could ever match her. Certainly not Gal. Her Evil Queen went out with a whizz pop, not a bang completely robbing us of seeing the comeuppance of good vs evil finale she (and the audience) deserved.

"Disney's live-action remake of ""Snow White"" is a dismal failure that tarnishes the legacy of the beloved classic. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks the charm and innocence that defined the original character, leaving audiences disconnected and disappointed. The film's attempt to modernize the narrative results in a convoluted plot that strays too far from its source material, alienating longtime fans. Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen is equally underwhelming, failing to evoke the menace and allure essential to the role. The overuse of CGI, particularly in the depiction of the seven dwarfs, is jarring and detracts from the film's visual appeal. Moreover, the lackluster musical numbers are forgettable and fail to capture the magic of the original score.

"I went into Snow White hoping for at least a decent adaptation, but this movie turned out to be an absolute train wreck. It fails on every level-storytelling, casting, visuals, and even basic entertainment value.

First off, the script is a mess. The film takes excessive liberties with the classic tale, stripping away its charm and replacing it with a dull, uninspired narrative that feels forced and preachy. The dialogue is laughably bad, making it impossible to take the characters seriously.

The casting choices are questionable at best. The lead performance lacks the warmth and charisma needed for the role, making it hard to connect with the character. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, delivering wooden performances that only add to the film's lack of emotional depth.

Visually, the movie looks like a cheap CGI overload. Instead of bringing the fairy tale to life, the effects look artificial and unconvincing, making scenes feel lifeless rather than magical. Even the costume and set designs fail to impress, looking uninspired and generic.

To top it off, the pacing is horrendous. The film drags in some parts and rushes through others, making it feel both boring and incoherent at the same time. Any attempt at humor falls flat, and there's no real sense of adventure or wonder-just a long, tedious experience that leaves you checking the time.

Overall, Snow White is an absolute disaster. It's an insult to the original story, a waste of talent, and a complete failure in filmmaking.

"Hollywood has officially run out of ideas, and this new Snow White remake is proof. Instead of honoring the timeless charm of the original, this film strips away everything that made it special, replacing it with forced modern messaging, lackluster performances, and a complete misunderstanding of its own source material.

First, let's talk about the obvious-this was never a movie that needed a remake. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is a classic that set the foundation for Disney's golden age of animation. It was beautifully animated, had iconic music, and, most importantly, heart. This version, on the other hand, is a bland, CGI-heavy mess with none of the magic.

The casting choices and script changes feel more like a marketing stunt than an attempt to tell a good story. The removal of key elements (like the dwarfs) and the rewriting of Snow White's character into something completely unrecognizable only further prove that the filmmakers had no real interest in staying true to the fairy tale. Instead of an innocent, kind-hearted princess, we now get a modernized, independent warrior who looks down on the original story. And let's be honest-if you don't respect the source material, why even bother remaking it?

The visuals are another disappointment. Despite Disney's massive budget, the CGI looks lifeless, and the costume designs are forgettable at best. The film lacks the handcrafted beauty of the animated original and instead feels like yet another generic, over-processed live-action attempt that no one really asked for.

Disney used to be about storytelling. Now, it's about ticking boxes and making headlines. This movie isn't about nostalgia or bringing a classic to a new generation-it's about using a beloved brand to push a half-baked modern narrative while cashing in on a known IP.

At the end of the day, this Snow White remake is unnecessary, uninspired, and utterly forgettable.

"When Disney decided to make a modern ""Snow White,"" they wanted to produce a contemporary adaptation of one of its cherished classic princess films that would appeal to everyone. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away everything that made the original special leaving this poisoned apple of a film that is devoid of the life and magic of the original.

The dopey artistic and effects choices made in this version won't make anyone happy, either. There was too much singing and not enough storytelling leading to a rather tedious experience.

While some musical numbers show potential, they are overly produced, which can detract from the authenticity of the performances. Rachel's impressive vocal talent, particularly evident in ""Spellbound,"" illustrates this point. It appears that in some instances, the focus on production has overshadowed the importance of crafting a film that truly connects with audiences.

Additionally, the film appears to fall short of its potential, resembling a production more similar to a made-for-TV movie. Disney seems to be facing challenges in effectively leveraging computer-generated effects, in contrast to the proficiency demonstrated by other studios, leading to an approach that prioritizes quantity over quality.

"Wow. Just wow. I walked into the theater hoping for a fresh take on a classic fairytale and left wondering if the writers had even read the original story. This new Snow White is less a movie and more a two-hour TED Talk wrapped in a painfully awkward musical.

The dialogue feels like it was written by a group chat full of marketing interns trying to be ""empowering"" without understanding character depth. Snow White herself is a charisma vacuum-wooden delivery, zero chemistry with anyone, and about as enchanting as a cold cup of tea. The dwarves? Barely there. And not a single one had a personality beyond ""background extra with a name.""

The CGI looks like it was outsourced to a laptop from 2006, and don't get me started on the songs. One of them rhymed ""dream"" with ""scream"" and honestly, that was fitting. I was screaming internally.

I was not expecting to like this movie much - the original is a masterwork for its time, but is dated. If this version had been a shot-for-shot remake, it would have been a waste of time.

Instead, the filmmakers took the core of the story, made it accessible to today's audience, infused it with amazing original music and dance, and produced something I'd gladly see again with my grandchildren.

Gal Gadot gave a great performance, in all aspects. Rachel Zegler used her innocence, beauty and voice to embody a hero we can all love. Andrew Burnap was Robin Hood-esque in heroism and charm.

There were a lottttt of similarities in the script to the ongoing war in the Middle East, with Gal as the rightful villain but I'm not sure that the studio knows that it even did that. Nor that she's aware, clearly. It's either a brilliant calculation or a ""mistake"" on Disney's part. Rachel (lord farquad snow) has spoken out advocating for history's correct side and her being on the run from terror was honestly about as close to reality any Disney movie has ever gotten.

"Disney's live-action Snow White is a complete disaster from start to finish. Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is uninspired, lacking the warmth and charm that made the original character beloved. She delivers her lines with little emotion, and her portrayal feels more like a rebellious teenager than a fairy tale princess.

The film's attempt to modernize the story falls flat, stripping away the classic romance and replacing it with a dull, uninspired narrative. The CGI dwarfs are unconvincing and awkward, making the movie visually unappealing. Even Gal Gadot, who should have been a highlight as the Evil Queen, is wasted in a role that fails to bring any real menace or intrigue.

The new songs are forgettable, the dialogue feels forced, and the overall tone of the movie is a confused mess.

The writing was painfully lackluster, filled with cringeworthy dialogue that felt more like a series of cliché catchphrases than genuine conversation. The plot meandered endlessly, lacking the charm and coherence that made the original so endearing. The awkward pacing made it hard to connect with any of the characters, particularly Snow White, who came off as bland and forgettable.

As for the cast, despite some commendable performances, they were working with very little. The dwarves, often the heart of the story, were reduced to caricatures, losing any semblance of depth or personality. Meanwhile, the villain was diminished to a mere shadow of her former self-more annoying than threatening.

Visually, while the film showcased some impressive scenery and effects, they often felt overused and distracting rather than enhancing the story. Instead of immersing us in the fairy tale world, it felt like a flashy cover hiding an empty shell.

"Unfortunately we reached a point where the expectations are set so low that even if the project itself is actually pretty decent (such as this picture) people are going to hate it no matter what.

Probably the biggest problem going into the movie is how inconsistent of a filmmaker Marc Webb is and obviously the elephant(s) I the room: Zegler and Gadot.

Zegler has some serious facial acting problems ant times and Gadot is well known as a mediocre actress at best, but Webb was actually able to somewhat hide those issues expertly.

Another really huge problem with Zegler was the fact that she's consider (by most) a worse looking woman than Gadot, but the casting choice was excellent with the direction that the screenplay took and didn't the fact that she's a black actress didn't feel forced at all.

I'm not here to call this a masterpiece, but I'm definitely defending a picture with great technical use of the camera and cgi, surprisingly good enough acting and a screenplay that made me feel like a kid, smiling and being emotional with the story as it progressed and that's what really matters in my opinion when watching these types of movies.",6/10,unfortun reach point expect set low even project actual pretti decent pictur peopl go hate matter probabl biggest problem go movi inconsist filmmak marc webb obvious eleph room zegler gadot zegler seriou facial act problem ant time gadot well known mediocr actress best webb actual abl somewhat hide issu expertli anoth realli huge problem zegler fact consid wors look woman gadot cast choic excel direct screenplay took fact black actress feel forc call masterpiec definit defend pictur great technic use camera cgi surprisingli good enough act screenplay made feel like kid smile emot stori progress realli matter opinion watch type movi,0.908,0.232,0.12,0.648,Positive
"I can't believe how badly Disney's Snow White 2025 turned out. As a fan of the original classic, I was expecting a fresh, thoughtful retelling, but instead, I was left with a complete disappointment. This film was a waste of both my time and money.

The most glaring issue for me was the character of Snow White herself. Instead of being the strong, iconic figure she was in the original, she was reduced to a joke. Gone was the grace and depth that made her memorable. Instead, she was written as a clumsy, uninspiring character with no real substance. Her portrayal was not only disappointing but downright cringeworthy at times, making it hard to take the film seriously. The way they handled her role felt more like a parody than a reimagining of the beloved princess.

The performances across the board were underwhelming. Despite the film's star-studded cast, the acting was flat, and the chemistry between the characters felt forced. The dwarfs, instead of being endearing, felt awkward and out of place, and the film's attempt at humor fell painfully short.

Visually, the movie had some moments of impressive CGI, but even that couldn't mask the film's lack of heart. The effects felt overdone, and the magical elements didn't evoke the wonder they should have. The pacing was slow, and the plot was uninspired. The film didn't add anything meaningful to the classic story-it just tried to cash in on nostalgia without understanding why the original was so special.

Overall, Snow White 2025 is a prime example of a remake that misses the mark in every way. Instead of honoring the character of Snow White, it reduces her to a punchline, and the rest of the film follows suit. I strongly regret spending my money and time on this film.

"The 2025 Snow White movie is a complete letdown, failing to capture the magic of the original 1937 Disney classic. While the idea of reimagining such an iconic tale had potential, the final product falls short in almost every way.

Story & Plot: The plot itself is uninspired, offering little more than a dull retelling of the original story. While the 1937 version was groundbreaking, enchanting, and full of heart, this 2025 version misses the mark. It lacks the charm, the emotional depth, and the timeless appeal that made the original Snow White so memorable. The story feels rushed and shallow, with key moments that should have felt emotional or dramatic falling flat. It's a forgettable experience rather than a captivating reimagining.

The Lead Actor: Perhaps the biggest issue with this Snow White is the casting. The main actor simply does not fit the role. Snow White is supposed to be innocent, charming, and full of life-but in this version, the actor feels out of place. There's no warmth or connection with the audience. She fails to evoke the same tenderness and strength that made the 1937 Snow White a beloved character. It's hard to care about her journey when her portrayal feels so disconnected from the essence of the character.

Comparing to the 1937 Classic: It's clear that the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a far superior film. That version, with its groundbreaking animation and heartfelt storytelling, has remained a timeless classic for a reason. This 2025 retelling lacks the warmth, depth, and enchantment that made the original such a success. The performances were strong in 1937, with each character bringing something unique and memorable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this modern version.

Conclusion: In short, the 2025 Snow White is a disappointing attempt at reviving a beloved classic. The story is flat, the lead actor is miscast, and it simply doesn't do justice to the original 1937 film. For anyone looking to relive the magic of Snow White, it's best to stick with the 1937 version, which remains the definitive and much more enjoyable take on the tale.

"I can't explain how disappointing this movie was. Simply disappointing. What the hell was that?

From the moment the first teaser dropped, Snow White (2025) sparked controversy, and unfortunately, the final product only amplified concerns. The decision to modernize the narrative by removing the prince and altering the portrayal of the seven dwarfs was seen as a significant departure from the original. Many fans who grew up with Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) were left confused and frustrated. This wasn't just a simple retelling-it was a complete overhaul of a beloved classic, one that left little resemblance to the timeless fairy tale.

Characterization & Performances

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen? Not for me. Sure, she looked the part-elegant, regal, and strikingly beautiful-but her performance lacked the gravitas needed to make the Queen truly menacing. Instead of exuding the chilling menace of the animated version, Gadot's Evil Queen often felt like a watered-down villain, more style than substance. Her character's motivations felt hollow, and despite her attempts to bring a sense of theatricality, it all fell flat.

Then there's Snow White herself. Snow White (played by Rachel Zegler) is no longer the passive princess waiting for true love's kiss. Instead, she is reimagined as an independent, strong-willed leader who dreams of ruling her kingdom without needing a prince. While the idea of a self-sufficient heroine is admirable, the execution left much to be desired. Instead of a charming and kind-hearted princess, this version of Snow White comes off as detached and, at times, unlikable. Zegler's performance is serviceable, but it lacks the warmth and sincerity that made the original character so endearing.

The Evil Queen (Gal Gadot) remains obsessed with Snow White's beauty, but the central conflict is now more about power than romance. While modernizing a fairy tale isn't inherently a bad thing, the way it was handled here stripped the story of its emotional core. The original Snow White wasn't just about romance-it was about kindness, innocence, and resilience. This version of the story, however, feels like a forced attempt to be ""progressive"" at the expense of its heart.

One of the most controversial changes is the complete removal of Prince Charming. While Disney has been moving away from the ""damsel in distress"" trope in recent years, the decision to remove the prince altogether left many fans wondering why the film was even called Snow White. The prince's role in the original was small, but his presence was symbolic. Here, the omission feels less like an organic change and more like an attempt to distance itself from traditional fairy tale elements entirely.

Additionally, the seven dwarfs are no longer the beloved, unique characters from the original but are instead replaced by a group of diverse magical creatures. This change, meant to be more ""inclusive,"" ended up alienating audiences even further. Fans cherished the dwarfs not just because they were short but because they each had distinct personalities that added charm and humor to the story. Replacing them with generic magical creatures resulted in a loss of character depth and emotional connection.

Visuals & Direction

Visually, Snow White has some beautiful moments. The cinematography is colorful and grand, and the costume design is impressive. However, the CGI used for the magical creatures and backgrounds feels inconsistent, making some scenes look artificial rather than immersive. There are moments of visual spectacle, but they are overshadowed by jarring CGI work that pulls you out of the experience rather than drawing you in.

The film's pacing also suffers, with certain moments dragging while others feel rushed. Scenes that should have been impactful lack weight, and the story's flow feels choppy. Director Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man) tries to inject a modern sensibility into the film, but the result feels disjointed. Instead of a timeless fairy tale, Snow White often feels like a generic fantasy film with a familiar name slapped onto it for brand recognition.

Final Verdict

Snow White had the potential to be a fresh and exciting update to a beloved classic. Instead, it comes off as a misguided attempt to modernize a story that didn't need drastic changes. With weak character development, controversial creative choices, and a script that feels more like a checklist of modern themes than a cohesive narrative, Snow White ultimately fails to capture the magic of the original.

At its core, Disney's Snow White feels like a film that doesn't know who it's for. It alienates fans of the original, disappoints those who wanted an exciting retelling, and frustrates audiences who wanted something more than a hollow attempt at ""progressive"" storytelling. If you were looking forward to a nostalgic, heartwarming experience, you won't find it here.

"I went into Snow White (2025) hoping for a fresh take on a beloved classic, but what I got was an absolute mess. From the uninspired performances to the baffling creative choices, this movie fails on every level.

First, the script is unbearably dull, filled with lifeless dialogue and forced ""modern"" updates that strip away the charm of the original. The changes to the story feel unnecessary and out of place, turning an enchanting fairy tale into a preachy, joyless slog.

The casting is another major issue. The lead performance lacks charisma, making Snow White more annoying than endearing. The supporting characters are forgettable, and the film completely mishandles its interpretation of the dwarfs, replacing them with unmemorable stand-ins that add nothing to the story.

Visually, it's a mixed bag. While some of the CGI looks decent, many scenes feel overly artificial and uninspired. The costumes and set design are bland, failing to capture the magic of the original film. Even the musical numbers, which should be a highlight, are flat and unmemorable.

Overall, Snow White (2025) is a soulless cash grab that completely misses the heart of the story. Instead of celebrating a classic, it awkwardly tries to ""modernize"" it in all the wrong ways. Disney needs to stop with these lifeless remakes and start focusing on original storytelling again.

"By Ian Chandler - March 25, 2025

The 2025 remake of Disney's Snow White is unnecessary, but does it have to be rated as low as Manos: The Hands of Fate? The film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the evil queen. First of all, I'll say that Zelger has an admittedly good voice, which is necessary for the musical numbers. However, the overall performances from the two leads are not outstanding. I don't know if it's because of the script, direction, or them eyeing a paycheck; whatever it is, the acting isn't exactly noteworthy. Despite the rough first impressions, this remake isn't nearly as soulless as the Lion King one from a few years ago. And, while I am at it, there is some, but not a sufficient amount of imagination in this project.

The film is a colorful adventure through and through. Some of the backgrounds pop with vibrancy and some of the CGI elements, mostly the animals, are adorable and expressive. However, the reliance on CGI is a bit on the heavy side, as it was also applied to the seven dwarves. Yes, you heard that right, the dwarves are CGI animations in this live-action remake. Have they forgotten about prosthetic makeup? They could have even pulled a trick from the Hobbit trilogy, where a taller character is on a green screen, enabling them to be digitally larger than the others. To give credit, though, these dwarves are expressive and are fun to be around.

The musical numbers are also a little forgettable, as the only one I could faintly remember is a song about whistling. The plot has similar beats to the original, but it seems to have taken some deviancies. Though I can see that angering some people, I am one of those people who likes to see some new ideas thrown in. Otherwise, you have virtually no reason to watch these remakes, as they are usually inferior to their source material. The pacing is also a little strange, as it is sometimes speedy, and other times it is as quick as a turtle. Neither are wrong by themselves, but the pacing must be consistent. The ending is a bit abrupt too.

The camerawork is nice, though. Some shots look rather good, but again, the overuse of CGI does hamper some to varying degrees. The goofy sequences with the dwarves are complimented by the zany cinematography. And just as mentioned before, the dwarves are easily the most enjoyable part of this movie. You might ponder whether or not it would have been a better idea to make a spinoff about their lifetimes instead. Even so, there is no reason for this film to be rated as low as 1.6! This movie? Sure, it is far from great, and it is a blatant cash grab; but there is some entertainment to be found here, at least. Also, it's far better than that Lion King remake. Though, I must mention, I haven't seen the original Snow White movie in full, despite how revolutionary and acclaimed it was. Perhaps that will invalidate some of my points here.

Score: 60/100

"This movie had so much negativity attached to it from the beginning. When this happens you really have to try and be extra, extra, extra positive and hope it ends up proving those people wrong.

Nope, this is not the movie that will do that.

With the budget allocated for this movie, you expect the CGI to be amazing, nope.

You expect the costumes to be stunning. Nope. It really came across as low budget for the majority, especially Snow Whites.

Even the performances from the big draw card of Gal was underwhelming.

"I wanted to love this remake, but the actress that played snow whites part was a total failure. The actress that played the evil queen should have taken the role of Snow White. I don't know what Disney was thinking. Waste of 26 dollars at the theater, so disappointed. I think the movie would have been better if they had decided to stick to the original storyline and cast a better main actress.

"This film is awful! The visuals feel uninspired, with CGI that looks more dated than dazzling, and the script is a dull, lifeless retread of better adaptations. The emotional beats fall flat, and the attempts at modernizing the story come off as forced rather than fresh. Even the lead performance struggles to shine amid awkward pacing and poorly written dialogue.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen wasn't just disappointing - it was downright painful. Her performance felt more like a bored celebrity cameo than a menacing, iconic villain. Every line delivery was stiff and lifeless, making it impossible to take her seriously.

Instead of the regal, terrifying presence we expected, we got awkward smirks and a flat, fashion-model-gone-bad vibe. No depth, no menace - just a face doing a bad impression of a villain.

This movie was a disaster from start to finish, but Gadot's performance was the final nail in the coffin. A reimagining that no one asked for and even fewer will remember...",1/10,film aw visual feel uninspir cgi look date dazzl script dull lifeless retread better adapt emot beat fall flat attempt modern stori come forc rather fresh even lead perform struggl shine amid awkward pace poorli written dialogu gal gadot portray evil queen disappoint downright pain perform felt like bore celebr cameo menac icon villain everi line deliveri stiff lifeless make imposs take serious instead regal terrifi presenc expect got awkward smirk flat vibe depth menac face bad impress villain movi disast start finish gadot perform final nail coffin reimagin one ask even fewer rememb,-0.9565,0.088,0.253,0.659,Negative
"If I realized this movie was going to eat up 2 hours of my life for nothing, I'd have bailed before the opening credits. The plot was exhausting- convoluted and stale, and it didn't even try to honour the original story. I went in hoping for a clever reimagining, but it's just a jumbled mess with over the top visuals and a storyline that feels desperate to be relevant but misses by a mile. They could have made a new movie with this plot instead of completely disgracing the cartoon.

I will say that Zegler's got an incredible voice, but her acting seems stiff- as if she's trying to sell the empowerment angle too hard.",1/10,realiz movi go eat hour life noth bail open credit plot convolut stale even tri honour origin stori went hope clever reimagin jumbl mess top visual storylin feel desper relev miss mile could made new movi plot instead complet disgrac cartoon say zegler got incred voic act seem tri sell empower angl hard,0.8591,0.217,0.085,0.698,Positive
"The acting in this film leaves much to be desired, as many performances feel flat and unconvincing, failing to bring the characters to life in a meaningful or engaging way. The emotional depth that made the original so compelling is largely absent, making it difficult to connect with the characters on any level. One of the most jarring aspects of this adaptation is the CGI dwarves, which are not only unsettling but outright terrifying. Their artificial, almost uncanny appearance makes them difficult to take seriously and significantly detracts from the overall viewing experience. Instead of enhancing the story, the CGI feels out of place and distracting, pulling focus away from the narrative and breaking immersion at key moments. The decision to use CGI in this way ultimately does a disservice to the film, making it feel more like an animated feature than a live-action adaptation. What made the original so special was its charm, warmth, and the authenticity of its characters, but much of that has been stripped away in favor of a visually flashy but emotionally hollow experience. The heart of the story seems to have been lost in the process, replaced with a cold, artificial aesthetic that fails to capture the magic and wonder of the original. Instead of feeling like a loving tribute or a fresh take, this version comes across as a misguided attempt to modernize something that never needed changing in the first place.",1/10,act film leaf much desir mani perform feel flat unconvinc fail bring charact life meaning engag way emot depth made origin compel larg absent make difficult connect charact level one jar aspect adapt cgi dwarf unsettl outright terrifi artifici almost uncanni appear make difficult take serious significantli detract overal view experi instead enhanc stori cgi feel place distract pull focu away narr break immers key moment decis use cgi way ultim disservic film make feel like anim featur adapt made origin special charm warmth authent charact much strip away favor visual flashi emot hollow experi heart stori seem lost process replac cold artifici aesthet fail captur magic wonder origin instead feel like love tribut fresh take version come across misguid attempt modern someth never need chang first place,0.7003,0.147,0.116,0.737,Positive

"It was just bad. Very bad. A couple highlights but dozens of letdowns.

Love that they paid homage to many of the 1937 scenes, like the haunted forest scene and the amazing ""Whistle While You Work"" number.

But the other scenes, including the TERRIBLE CGI of the dwarves coupled with Gal Gadot's stiff and cringey performance, were an apple for disaster.

Definitely think there is a lot of merit in the lessons to be taught in the storyline, but it does linger quite a lot in the middle of the film, though it starts and ends with a few good scenes.

I can only give this film 2 stars, one for Rachel Zegler's phenomenal voice/acting and the other for the costuming.

Definitely the worst of all live-action remakes, executed poorly, and what sucks is it had so much potential, but in the end, the poison apple appeared more satisfying.

"Sad to say the ""Someday my princess will come"" is not part of the movie itself. Remove Two songs that signifies Snow white. Why remove the song, why not just add but don't remove the song that specifically portray Snow White.

I wish they learn from their mistakes, specifically in the earlier times many people against on it after the casting of the roles, but they still continue it despite of the reaction of the people.

"The OG Snow White, @disney 's first feature animation is one of my all time favourite's, it was a go to as a child and went into the VHS player way too many times to count.

I'm going to be honest, I was sceptical going into it, unsure of what they might have changed or added, but they have expanded the world of Snow White perfectly, will bringing it into the modern era of film and story telling, while keeping the classic old Hollywood charm, it's absolutely wonderful!

Although I would have loved to see live action little people, the CGI Angry, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, Dopey and Doc are just as charming and adorable as the original, I was worried they would have an uncanny valley creepiness but they don't at all! As soon as I saw Dopey, I was won over!

The new music is fab and intertwines perfectly with the classic tunes you know and love (I can see this now as a great stage musical) plus the sets, the costumes, the animals and the world that's been created is so so well done!

"My friend and I decided to watch this movie to reminisce, the unique casting and storytelling that gives a new twist is quite refreshing, the acting of the players is quite good, I hope Gal Gadot can be a little more brutal, but considering this movie will be enjoyed by children, I tried to enjoy it with an open mind. The CGI is also quite fun, the animals that appear are very characterful and memorable, the 7 dwarfs are fun, and the depiction of their beautiful home and the mine where they work is quite good. The climax scene is quite good even though I was confused by the red veil worn by Snow White with a story from a different movie. The songs are beautiful and the colors throughout the movie are very vivid and fun.

"I don't understand why Disney insists on ruining our classic movies. If you want to remake something, at least respect the original story and improve it with better visuals, performances, or effects-not by changing the core narrative.

Use your creativity, but don't ruin our movies. Classics are classics for a reason!!!

The weirdness for this was too much. I understand that Remakes are tough business.

"Disney's Snow White (2025) is less a fairytale and more a cautionary tale-about how not to remake a beloved classic. Clocking in at 1 hour and 49 minutes, this film manages to feel twice as long, thanks to its lifeless pacing, bland dialogue, and performances that barely register on the emotional scale.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks warmth and wonder, coming off more like a disinterested motivational speaker than the charming heroine we remember. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen?

"Even though her voice is great, it's funny that she's Latina-and so is her mother. She doesn't portray any of Snow White's sweetness; she's just angry at the Queen all the time. She can be angry, but there still needs to be some of Snow White's innocence and gentleness. Even when she sings, she doesn't feel like a princess at all. I felt like she was playing Lucy Gray again.

Rachel Zegler (Snow White) is excellent in the role. She belts out song after song. My favourite part was the dwarfs. The film updates their songs for a modern day feel and makes them as slapstick as the original film. My daughter and I laughed hard at their antics.

What has happened to this once grand producer of wonderful cinema?

The agenda, the message, the disregard for history, character development, narrative.

All we get these days is glossy vapid preachy nonsense, again the CGI is a disaster, they should have made the little people the evil characters in the movie because they caused far more fear and dread in us than the so-called evil queen did. I'm predicting the kids will have nightmares from those 7 abhorations Disney threw at us.

For us older viewers, it's impossible to watch the film and see Zegler on the screen without immediately thinking about her toxic entitled rhetoric in all interviews given to promote the film and it immediately takes you out of the picture until those terrifying little people return to zap you away from your thoughts and back into terror.

Gadot should have been wonderful as the evil queen but somehow she just wasn't.

"Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White is nothing short of a disaster. Instead of embodying the warmth, charm, and innocence that made the original character so beloved, she delivers a performance that feels forced, detached, and utterly lifeless. Her line delivery lacks emotion, her expressions are awkward, and at times, it seems like she's just reading from a script rather than bringing a character to life.

There's no sincerity in her performance, and her attempts at conveying strength or independence come off as shallow and uninspired. Even her interactions with other characters feel unnatural, as if she's simply going through the motions without any genuine connection. In a film that desperately needed a strong lead to carry its modernized vision, Zegler's flat, charisma-free acting drags the entire movie down.

Disney could have cast someone who understood the heart of Snow White, but instead, we got a protagonist who seems embarrassed to even be in the role.

"The remake of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" fell flat for several reasons, leaving audiences disappointed. It lacked the charm and magic of the original, leaning heavily on modernized storytelling that felt forced and out of sync with the beloved classic. Key characters were poorly developed, and the dynamic between Snow White and the dwarves, which was central to the original, felt watered down. Additionally, the production decisions, such as uninspired set designs and lackluster special effects, failed to evoke the whimsical fairy-tale ambiance that fans cherish. Many viewers felt the remake prioritized style over substance, leaving behind the heart and soul of the story that made the original an enduring masterpiece. It serves as a reminder that reimagining a classic requires capturing the essence of the original while adding fresh, meaningful layers-not just superficial updates.",1/10,remak snow white seven dwarf fell flat sever reason leav audienc disappoint lack charm magic origin lean heavili modern storytel felt forc sync belov classic key charact poorli develop dynam snow white dwarf central origin felt water addit product decis uninspir set design lacklust special effect fail evok whimsic ambianc fan cherish mani viewer felt remak priorit style substanc leav behind heart soul stori made origin endur masterpiec serf remind reimagin classic requir captur essenc origin ad fresh meaning superfici updat,0.4767,0.134,0.09,0.776,Positive
"I really wanted to like this. I really did. I was familiar with all the negative comments prior to its opening, but I have seen many fine films attacked unfairly for a variety of reasons that I've ended up loving. I do not allow critic reviews or peoples opinions to determine my love of a film I wanted SNOW WHITE to be one that was maligned by others but loved by me. Sadly, it wasn't. Even at an hour and 49 minutes the movie drags terribly. I was bored too much of the time. There are subplots to the original story that come out of nowhere that make little sense to why they are there other than to give the old story a little kick. The message that is sent at the end is a good one, but it's conveyed too late in the story and not strong enough. The mixture of live action and CGI occasionally blend nicely, but all too often reminds one of the process and takes the viewer out of the story. I kept thinking ""why didn't they just stick to the original and make the entire movie CGI""? That would've been more visually exciting than the weird combination of dark effects you get here. Poor Rachel Zegler has a nice persona, but doesn't possess the necessary ""magic"" needed for the character. She's stuck in a dull fantasy where too much responsibility is placed upon her to hold together. She's frankly a little too mature for the part of Snow White and while Gal Gadot works valiantly to muster evil in every expression, the woman is too nice and friendly looking to ever be perceived as frightening or evil. She and Zegler could easily switch roles. The one nice piece of casting is Andrew Burnap who is at home in these type of surroundings and is refreshing as the counter part to the Prince. The CGI Dwarfs, rather than endearing, often made me cringe in embarrassment. I might have warmed up to the picture if the score was good. It isn't. The new songs are horribly monotone sounding like they're trying desperately to be like prior Disney musicals. I really hated the score. In short, the movie lacks imagination and is all over the place in search of what it wants to be. A real flatfooted disappointment for this viewer.

"Talk about your strange (really, really BAD) casting choices and mismatched talent! Rachel Zegler as the ""... fairest of them all"" while Gal Gadot comes in at second place creates a dissonance for the audience while trying to watch the movie. Nothing against Rachel whatsoever, but she should've been the queen because she looks so much older than Gal Gadot (who really shouldn't have even been in this production in the first place).

Gal Gadot has a ton of presence on screen. It's just too much for her to be cast as the second fiddle. If she's in a scene, all eyes are immediately on her, she's got the audience's sympathy and attention, and if she isn't the story, the story seems less significant like background or filler.

The last time I can recall such poorly matched stars in a movie was Titanic. I loved the movie, but a grown woman upending her whole life for a kid that looked like he just dropped out of high school?

"This movie is a textbook example of how to alienate the very people who would have supported it. Instead of respecting the timeless charm of Snow White, they decided to reinvent it for an audience that was never interested in the first place. The result? A soulless, confused mess that lacks any of the magic, heart, or storytelling that made the original beloved.

The irony is almost comical-casting a supermodel as the Evil Queen while having Snow White played by someone who, let's just say, doesn't quite fit the role. And let's not forget the male lead, who looks like Lord Farquaad in live-action. It's as if they deliberately wanted to parody themselves.

The visuals? Dull and uninspired. The writing? Preachy and lifeless. The acting? Forced and unnatural.

"As someone who grew up loving Snow White, I was genuinely looking forward to this new version. But right from the beginning, it was hard to stay engaged - mainly because the casting of Snow White just doesn't work.

The role of Snow White has always carried a certain image: soft-spoken, kind-hearted, and with a kind of timeless beauty that fits the fairy-tale world. Unfortunately, the actress in this adaptation doesn't quite capture any of that. Her presence on screen feels out of sync with the character's essence - both in how she looks and how she carries the role. There's a noticeable lack of warmth and that dreamy, classic charm you'd expect.

Reinterpreting a story is one thing, but when the lead feels miscast, it makes it difficult to connect with the film at all.

"I had low expectations for Snow White 2025, but somehow it still managed to underwhelm. The film takes a beloved story and drowns it in heavy-handed messaging, clunky dialogue, and a plot that feels like it was stitched together by a committee with no clear vision. The CGI is shockingly subpar-think early 2000s video game cutscenes-and the dwarfs (or whatever they're calling them now) are reduced to forgettable caricatures that add nothing to the story.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White tries hard, but the script gives her little to work with; she oscillates between wooden and overly dramatic without finding a believable middle ground. The songs, which should've been a highlight, are forgettable at best and cringe-inducing at worst- autotune can't save lyrics that sound like they were written by an AI with no soul. The pacing drags, stretching a simple fairy tale into a bloated 2-hour slog that left me checking my watch.

This isn't a fresh take; it's a soulless cash grab that disrespects the original while failing to stand on its own.

It is very sad that Disney has failed in this production in such a way that you feel you have wasted time and money to see this film.

"Snow White, Disney's latest film, is a fresh take on the 1937 animated classic. Director Marc Webb gives the film a Broadway twist, making it more than just a nostalgic tale. With the addition of new songs and character development, the film adds a deeper dimension to the Snow White story.

Rachel Zegler does a great job of playing Snow White, giving the character more depth and spunk. She maintains the graceful movements of the animated Snow White, but with a new twist of spunk. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen gives a charming performance, although her voice doesn't always match the character.

The film has some flaws, such as the CGI effects that don't always work and the costumes look cheap. However, Webb manages to keep the film interesting with dynamic scenes and bright colors.

Overall, Snow White is one of Disney's best films of the last decade.

"I approached this ""adaptation"" with a cautious optimism, but it quickly devolved into a baffling cinematic experience. It's a tragedy to witness a beloved animated classic so thoroughly mishandled in the name of ""modernization."" Disney should have simply created an original film. The narrative felt disjointed and misdirected, while the CGI was jarringly poor, creating a disconnect from any sense of immersion. My three-year-old, accustomed to the animated version, was visibly upset by the jarring visual differences. The casting choices were questionable, with a lead actress lacking the necessary charisma to carry such an iconic role. The script meandered, and the acting, in general, was wooden and unconvincing. This film embodies everything that's wrong with contemporary cinema's approach to classic adaptations. It's a complete disaster, and a profound disappointment.

"I watched Snow White (2025) at InOrbit's PVR Mx4D, and the experience was nothing short of transportive. The moment the story began to unfold, it wasn't just a cinematic journey-it was an emotional return to my first-grade days at Holy Name High School, Colaba, where fairy tales felt as real as the sea breeze outside our classroom windows.

Directed by Marc Webb and written by Erin Cressida Wilson, Greta Gerwig, and Dorothy Ann Blank, this live-action Disney adaptation stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White, Gal Gadot as the sinister yet mesmerizing Evil Queen, and Andrew Burnap in a supporting role. The film gives the 1937 animated classic a fresh, musical spin-with a Latina Snow White leading the way through a forest of magic, menace, and self-discovery.

Interestingly, as I watched the film in full Mx4D immersion, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was watching a fusion of three classic fairy tales: Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Little Red Riding Hood. Perhaps it was the enchanted slumber, the dark and mysterious forest, or the deceptive appearances of danger wrapped in beauty-it all felt like a richly woven fairy-tale tapestry, where the innocence of youth meets the lurking shadows of fear and fate.

The visual effects were enchanting, the Mx4D effects-from the whooshing forest winds to the jolts of surprise-made every magical moment feel tangible. The performances were sincere, with Zegler bringing a quiet strength to Snow White, and Gal Gadot channeling icy elegance as the Evil Queen.

Though the film is tracking a modest box office opening ($45-55 million), it shines as a heartfelt reimagining that brings Disney's classic to a new generation-with fresh faces, diverse voices, and a modern undercurrent of empowerment.

In the end, it wasn't just a fantasy on screen-it was a mirror into the fairy tales that shaped our childhood imaginations, now retold with emotional depth and dazzling artistry.

Disney is approaching its centennial, and over these 100 years, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) continues to be the BIGGEST HIT they ever produced (109 million tickets sold in North America). Unsure why they decided to redo the iconic film after 90 years, only to tarnish their own legacy. Snow White is a cheerful movie, until you reach the climax, which kills it more than the poisoned apple ever could. Even though it's a borrowed tale, you'll observe the alterations and additions in the script and wonder, ""who approved these clichés?""

In the opening scene, if the younger version of Snow White appears more beautiful than the adolescent version of Snow White, then you've started off on the wrong foot, mate. If the magic mirror reveals that Rachel Zegler is more beautiful and fairer than Gal Gadot, then you certainly have a problematic product on your hands. If your movie doesn't conclude with the ""true love kiss,"" you've really failed it. If the Evil Queen can be vanquished through conversation, then I have no interest, Marc brother.

The tale of Snow White, as everyone knows, revolves around Snow White (both externally and internally) who is turned into a servant by the Evil Queen. The Evil Queen has taken great pride in being the fairest of all, but her arrogance is shattered when the magic mirror reveals that Snow White is the fairest. The Queen now desires Snow White, also known as the Princess, to be dead, but she is granted life by her killer and is left to reside in an enchanted forest. The princess seeks refuge in the sole house she spots, owned by seven dwarfs, each representing a different human emotion-Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. The princess is looking for her father but the dwarfs ask her to stay here, stay safe; will she listen?

In contrast to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, this remake portrays the Prince in a new way-as a Rebel, specifically speaking. Why the hell did you do that? As stated earlier, the true Love's kiss seems ineffective as it doesn't create that singular ideal moment of a ""perfect Happy ending."" The film runs longer from there. Snow White's musical pieces are effective at certain moments, but others can be very dull. Certain dialogues are also not positioned effectively. Quite reminiscent of the legendary conversation between Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart about ""how to whistle"" in ""To Have and Have Not"" (1944), our Snow White instructs Dopey and the other dwarfs on the same topic, namely, ""how to whistle."" That appeared adorable, however. Additionally, numerous scenes in the movie appeared delightful and joyful, including the introduction of animals, the opening song featuring the seven dwarfs, and the house cleaning sequence. On the downside, the film overlooked some stunning scenes from the original, with my favorite being Snow White's joyful gathering with birds and animals at home.

Regarding performances, I think Snow White had the potential to be much better than how the actors have portrayed it. Rachel Zegler appears excessively white and fair, yet she was decent overall. Gal Gadot's accent appeared more English this time, surprisingly, yet the character didn't resonate effectively. Andrew Burnap portrays the new character, who, despite his satisfactory to reasonable performance, appears entirely out of place in the context. The backing of Ansu Kabia, Patrick Page, and Hadley Fraser was barely perceptible, while all those seven dwarfs appeared cute on occasion but visually unappealing at other times. One cannot be so childish with a $250 million budget film.

Snow White lacks captivating music and visual charm, which are essential for any live-action adaptation. Disney is undoubtedly running low on concepts, which is why they are recreating many of their legendary blockbusters. I firmly believe that Snow White wasn't the appropriate choice for the remake era. The visual effects are even worse than you'd imagine, and the casting of Zegler and Gadot in specific roles is surely one of the biggest F-ups in recent memory. Marc Webb's contemporary take on the cult classic nearly won me over; indeed, Disney's Snow White was almost a winner, until it lost to its own potential and legacy. The final 20-25 minutes of the film have turned it into a terrible remake by far; I mean, it completely lost me during that part. If there were no Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, then Snow White could have possibly worked for me. But what would Disney have been without Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? I suppose nothing. However, Disney without Snow White would have had ""no impact"" on the world. So, skip watching it if you cherish, admire, and honor the original. Let Disney suffer.

"N Disney's 2025 live-action adaptation of ""Snow White,"" Gal Gadot portrays the Evil Queen with a flamboyant and sinister flair. Her performance is marked by imposing body language and movements, effectively conveying the character's malevolence. However, some critics note that her portrayal lacks depth, with her singing and dialogue not fully capturing the character's operatic essence. Despite these critiques, Gadot's embodiment of the Evil Queen adds a campy and unrepentantly evil presence to the film.

I walked in the cinema with low expectations yet was stunned at how bad it all was. Rachel Zegler really needs to try and get into Brazzers or Hookup Hotshot. Her future would be great there. Rachel has a great body and needs to be utilised better.

They should have either Batgirled this movie or just put it on Disney+. This is anything but a theaterworthy movie.

"I tried to like this. I really did. Rachel Zegler's acting was good, but I didn't have a connection to her. The movie felt rushed and the relationships weren't sincere. It wasn't believable that Snow White was the ""fairest of them all"" because it didn't show her do anything special! I found myself bored halfway through. The makeup and special effects were lack luster and the costumes looked cheap. The costumes needed to be more elegant. They used the brightest blue and yellow for Snow White's gown, which is fine for a cartoon, but not a life action. I absolutely hated the zigzags on her maid dress. When the queen transformed into the old hag, her makeup looked like it was melting off. When she spoke it looked just weird! They also got rid of Prince Charming. No prince. Just Jonathan.

"Unfortunately all this movie does is remind of how amazing Disney's 1937 classic is. The characters are generally flat. The evil queen's ""evil"" just doesn't come through; I wish I could blame it solely on Disney's storyboarding, but Ms. Gadot's performance does the character no favors. Ms. Zegler took on no small challenge in her role reprising the character representing peak Disney fantasy and magic. I would forgive any inherent misses in her acting prowess (or lack thereof), but it's all but impossible to get past Disney's modernization of her character. Modernization in itself is no problem (see Baz Luhrmann's take on a story 400 years its senior), but Disney failed to adjust Snow White's entire formula, leaving the viewer to cherry pick when, where, and how to suspend disbelief in an otherwise magical character. The most egregious disappointment was the dwarves. Again, Disney has failed to recognize that the rubber-banded rag doll humor of the 1937 dwarves simply cannot be duplicated in CG, especially when the art design can't decide where it belongs in the spectrum of ""real to ""cartoon"". Remakes are inherently at a disadvantage; still, Disney made specific plot and character choices to resonate with some recent quakes in popular culture: that was a mistake.

"It's a shame Rachael Ziegler got bad press for interviews cause she's just magical in this and I think a lot of girls would really love this film.there were definitely still families at the showing I attended. She can really sing well and embodies Snow White in a very lovely way. Her hair is short because the evil queen cuts it like that out of jealousy. Speaking of the evil queen I thought Gal Gadot was great too and sang well in her number. It had the perfect touch of camp while still being evil. The entire score is really hummable - heigh ho and whistle while you work were great as well as the new waiting on a wish. It was a misstep to not include the gorgeous ""One Song"" from the original - it could have been worked in despite lack of a prince. There are just a lot of things I think were not that bad once I actually saw the film like the backgrounds and costumes. The one big mistake was in not using human actors for the dwarves. They could have changed the appearance as was done in the Tolkien films. The love interest who is an actor turned thief is fine as well.

"Snow White tries to simultaneously be a complete reinvention of the animated original and a very faithful adaptation where scenes are lifted directly from its predecessor so the results are undoubtedly messy but it avoids being the worst Disney live action remake. It tries to fix most of the problems with its source material in a noble fashion and a lot of the new ideas work well enough, they just almost go unnoticed thanks to the couple of truly baffling ones.

Rachel Zegler is this film's saving grace. Her fantastic singing voice gets plenty of moments to shine and she consistently imbues the film with all the necessary warmth and elegance despite everything working against her, mainly the unflattering haircut she has and some uncanny scene partners. Gal Gadot gives a career worst performance, even if she's clearly relishing the villainy she gets to play it's just so painful to watch, especially when she starts singing.

The no longer titular seven dwarves are relentlessly uncanny and the camera gets way too close to them most of the time which only makes it worse. The second they appear the film goes straight into the uncanny valley and even though they remain a jolly highlight throughout as they did in the original, it's never enough to fully escape it. It's such a strange (at best) creative choice however, the new character arc given to Dopey really works.

Marc Webb's direction is completely authorless and it makes no sense that he'd choose to make this after the notoriously tumultuous production of his Amazing Spider-Man duology under Sony. There's some vibrant sequences and it's generally pretty colourful, only employing a bland grey palette for scenes where it kinda fits.

The lead performance? Flat. The dialogue? Laughable. The CGI? Somehow worse than movies from 20 years ago. The heart and magic that made the original timeless? Completely obliterated. It's like they actively tried to suck all the fun and charm out of it.

"I loved the representation within the movie and the amazing visuals. The new Snow White movie, directed by Marc Webb and featuring Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, is a breathtaking reimagining of the beloved classic that successfully intertwines nostalgia with modern storytelling. With stunning visuals, a powerful soundtrack, and a fresh take on character development, this film is a must-see for both fans of the original and newcomers alike.

From the very first scene, the film captivates audiences with its enchanting visuals. The cinematography is nothing short of spectacular, showcasing lush forests, vibrant colors, and intricate set designs that bring the fairy tale world to life. Each frame feels like a painting, drawing viewers into the magical realm where Snow White resides. The attention to detail in costume design also deserves praise, as it beautifully reflects the characters' personalities and the film's overall aesthetic.

Rachel Zegler delivers a remarkable performance as Snow White, embodying the character's innocence, strength, and determination. Unlike the traditional portrayal of Snow White as merely a damsel in distress, this version presents her as a proactive and resilient young woman who is not afraid to stand up for herself and fight against injustice. Zegler's vocal talents shine in several musical numbers, adding depth to her character and making her journey even more relatable. Her chemistry with the supporting cast, particularly the seven dwarfs, is heartwarming and adds a layer of camaraderie that enhances the overall narrative.

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is equally impressive. She brings a commanding presence to the role, effectively capturing the character's complexity. The film delves into the Queen's backstory, exploring her motivations and insecurities, which adds depth to her villainy. Gadot's performance is both fierce and vulnerable, making her a formidable antagonist while also eliciting sympathy from the audience. The dynamic between Snow White and the Evil Queen is central to the story, and their encounters are filled with tension and emotional weight.

The film's soundtrack is another standout feature, with original songs that perfectly complement the story. The music, composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, captures the essence of the characters and their journeys. Each song is intricately woven into the narrative, enhancing key moments and evoking a range of emotions. The musical numbers are choreographed beautifully, making them a joy to watch and listen to. The blend of classic fairy tale themes with contemporary musical styles creates a unique auditory experience that resonates with audiences of all ages.

One of the most significant aspects of this adaptation is its emphasis on themes of empowerment and self-discovery. The film encourages viewers to embrace their individuality and fight for what they believe in. Snow White's journey is not just about finding love but also about discovering her own strength and purpose. This modern twist on the story resonates strongly with today's audiences, making it relevant and inspiring.

While the film pays homage to the original animated classic, it also takes bold steps to innovate and challenge traditional narratives. The inclusion of diverse characters and perspectives adds richness to the story, allowing for a broader representation that reflects our world today. The seven dwarfs, portrayed by a talented ensemble cast, are given distinct personalities and backstories, making them more than just side characters. Their camaraderie with Snow White is heartwarming and adds layers to the film's narrative.

In terms of pacing, the film flows seamlessly, balancing moments of action, drama, and lightheartedness. The screenplay is well-crafted, with witty dialogue and poignant moments that keep the audience engaged throughout. The film's climax is thrilling and emotional, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats and ultimately delivering a satisfying conclusion.

Overall, the new Snow White movie is a triumph that successfully blends nostalgia with modern sensibilities. With its stunning visuals, powerful performances, and a compelling narrative, it stands out as a remarkable adaptation of a beloved fairy tale.

"Snow White is the newest Disney live action remake, and it isn't bad. But could be better. The most controversial part about this film is Rachel Zegler, but she is the best part of this movie. The girl knows how to sing (like we saw on hunger games, and other films), and she sings beautifully in this movie. Speaking of singing, the songs in this movie aren't bad. Most of the Disney life action remake don't have good original songs but when you switch over to this movie, there's actually a handful amount of them that I find really good and catchy. Now Gal Gadot is getting hated in this movie saying it is her worst performance yet but the way I see it. She almost matched the role of the evil queen perfectly, now I do have a few Nitpicks, but I didn't hate her performance. And this movie fixed all of my problems that I had with the original film, the pacing is better in this movie and we fleshed out the characters more instead of the storylines being rushed. All my problems with the original film isn't in this movie, so theoretically that will make this movie better than the original. But this movie introduced new problems that stop it from being better than the original. First off the movie feels like a completely different story. It has the Snow White story in there, but the overall story with the evil queen and Snow White royalty is completely different and just doesn't match the classic that we know. Makes it feel like a completely different movie and that they only put Snow White in this movie so that people went out and saw it. Earlier I did talk about Gal Gadot and how she matched the evil queen almost perfectly with her performance. But her singing sounds awful in here, I never liked the song She's singing in this movie and her performance doesn't help. She's singing in the way that doesn't really match the evil queen. And the song just sounds completely off and the song just feels forced into the movie. I do think the first hour of this movie is really solid, but the second half of the movie is where it started to really go downhill. Partially because that's where the new story comes into play, but it also captured none of the magic that the original Snow White movie had. And the romance just felt forced, it felt like they only had the romance in there just for snow White to wake up from the poison apple. And the CGI dwarfs don't look as bad as they did in the trailer, but they still don't look good. I don't understand why they didn't hire an actual person to play the role instead of the CGI dwarfs. But overall, Snow White still at least captures the same magic that the original classic had, and fixing a lot of my problems that I had of the original movie. But they changed so much of the story that it just doesn't feel like the same movie anymore and feels like a completely different movie, but a boring plot that doesn't capture the same magic that the original movie had. And at the end of the day comes off as an another boring live action remake.",6/10,snow white newest disney live action remak bad could better controversi part film rachel zegler best part movi girl know sing like saw hunger game film sing beauti movi speak sing song movi bad disney life action remak good origin song switch movi actual hand amount find realli good catchi gal gadot get hate movi say worst perform yet way see almost match role evil queen perfectli nitpick hate perform movi fix problem origin film pace better movi flesh charact instead storylin rush problem origin film movi theoret make movi better origin movi introduc new problem stop better origin first movi feel like complet differ stori snow white stori overal stori evil queen snow white royalti complet differ match classic know make feel like complet differ movi put snow white movi peopl went saw earlier talk gal gadot match evil queen almost perfectli perform sing sound aw never like song sing movi perform help sing way realli match evil queen song sound complet song feel forc movi think first hour movi realli solid second half movi start realli go downhil partial new stori come play also captur none magic origin snow white movi romanc felt forc felt like romanc snow white wake poison appl cgi dwarf look bad trailer still look good understand hire actual person play role instead cgi dwarf overal snow white still least captur magic origin classic fix lot problem origin movi chang much stori feel like movi anymor feel like complet differ movi bore plot captur magic origin movi end day come anoth bore live action remak,-0.8944,0.161,0.181,0.658,Negative

"This movie falls flat on every level. It strays too far from the beloved classic many of us grew up with, losing the charm and heart along the way. While it clearly tries to modernize and outdo the original, it ends up failing across the board. The pacing is dull, the storytelling lacks depth, and the CGI is distractingly bad. A disappointing attempt at a remake that misses the mark entirely. The main actress completely misses the essence of Snow White's character. She brings none of the kindness, warmth, or innocence that made the original so beloved. Instead of capturing Snow White's charm and gentle spirit, her portrayal feels flat, disconnected, and lacking any emotional depth.

"What's the point of making a live-action version of a very old animated film if it's going to change absolutely everything that made the original story good? I simply don't understand the decisions that were made. I didn't mind the small change in the cast or the random selection of actors and actresses for the casting. But you can't change the entire story: the beginning, the middle, and the end. You also can't change the personalities of the main characters, much less minimize the evilness of the villain just because she's a woman. The setting looks great; I don't know if it was filmed in a real location or if CGI was used, although the CGI of the Seven Dwarfs is unpleasant to look at, especially through a giant screen in a dark room.

"There were many aspects of this movie that went above and below expectations. As someone who was ecstatic about this movie, it was a little underwhelming, but it did have its positives.

On one hand, the movie was overall entertaining. The ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""A Hand Meets a Hand"" were catchy additions to the soundtrack, and the additions to the storyline fit well within Disney's intentions to modernize them and add to the classic. For example, expanding upon the love interests involvement in the story and making him less of a random guy that shows up to kiss her eventually was a good way to make his involvement in the film less random. Developing their relationship gave more meaning to her awakening. Visually, the CGI for the mines and the forest scene were pretty cool. I also liked how they made the dwarfs more interesting as creatures. That is about as far as the positives for the film extend.

There was a lot to unpack with the negative parts of the movie. The Evil Queen's performance felt forced, flat, and just overall hard to watch. Snow White's hair has its ups and downs, but ultimately looked like lord farquaad when it mattered. The CGI dwarfs were kind of spooky, but not that bad. I understand what people mean when they say that you could tell that everything was sets, but that shouldn't take away from the details in the sets such as with the outside and inside of the cottage. The chemistry between Snow White and Johnathan was a little awkward. No, I don't think Snow White's outfit was horrendous and hideous. I actually liked that they gave her ballet shoes, because who is actually running around a Forrest in heels and not losing them?

The biggest things to remember are that first of all, these movies aren't just for fans of the original, but also for children who just want to see real-life princesses, and that this was a reimagining more than a remake. If you watch the movie, keep your standards to a minimum. If you pick apart everything about the movie, of course you're not going to enjoy it.

"I went into Snow White (2025) hoping for a fresh, bold take on a beloved classic - what I got was a muddled, joyless retelling that strips away the charm, magic, and emotional depth of the original.

First off, the writing is painfully bland. The script tries so hard to be modern and ""empowering"" that it forgets to actually tell a compelling story.

"Title: A Dismal Attempt at Magic

Review: ""Snow White"" (2025) is an unfortunate reminder of how far Disney has strayed from its roots. The film is a pure misfire, featuring an unbearable performance by the lead actress who struggles to convey even a hint of charm or depth. The once-beloved fairy tale is dragged down by uninspired dialogue and absurd attempts at modern relevance that fall flat. Everybody can easily how bad the CGI are just from the trailer so no need to deepen on this.

Rather than enchanting audiences, this version feels like a tedious obligation, making every sane person long for the classic storytelling and whimsical animation that made Disney shine.

"Movie completely misses the mark. While it tries to appeal to modern sensibilities, the result is a dull and uninspired retelling of the classic. The once magical elements are now lifeless, and the over-reliance on CGI makes the world feel artificial rather than enchanting. The film drags on with long, unnecessary scenes that leave you checking the time.

What's worse is that even children, who are the target audience, seemed uninterested and restless. The movie's attempt at humor is forced, and the characters, especially Snow White, are one-dimensional. The dwarfs, who were supposed to be quirky and lovable, feel flat and unremarkable. There's no heart in this version, and it struggles to capture the essence of the original tale, leaving viewers-young and old-feeling bored and disconnected.

I expected the worst and in the end I was pleasantly surprised, Gal Gadot stepped into the role and gave the goods, her song was catchy and I found myself humming the song after the movie. Rachel sang amazingly and in the end it was a children's fairy tale that was suitable for children of this age.

"3 out of 5 stars.

Snow White is a fair fantasy musical film based on the original animated film. There is some changes but the magic is missing in this one.

Pros: The plot is good. It's somewhat similar to the original with substituting Prince Charming for Jonathan. Which seemed a bit dull as a character.

Rachel Zegler did great as the role. Her performance and talent is growing and sweet. Gal Gadot as the evil queen was great.

The musical sequences are great. It does hit the high notes with a lot of heart.

Cons

The script felt a little underdeveloped with the characters. Jonathan who is supposed to be Snow Whites love interest was underdeveloped. Making his character dull. The evil queen another underdeveloped character that wastes the talent of Gal Gadot.

The visual effects were a bit of a miss. The dwarves looked like unfinished cgi work. Which was a sad thing. Cause those characters were supposed to be the lovable part of the film. And yet this film makes them forgettable.

Overall, it is an okay film with a great cast but the script is undeveloped in some areas making a lot of characters forgettable. And the visuals were a bit uneven. The musical sequences and casts were great with plenty of entertainment.",6/10,star snow white fair fantasi music film base origin anim film chang magic miss one pro plot good somewhat similar origin substitut princ charm jonathan seem bit dull charact rachel zegler great role perform talent grow sweet gal gadot evil queen great music sequenc great hit high note lot heart con script felt littl underdevelop charact jonathan suppos snow white love interest underdevelop make charact dull evil queen anoth underdevelop charact wast talent gal gadot visual effect bit miss dwarf look like unfinish cgi work sad thing caus charact suppos lovabl part film yet film make forgett overal okay film great cast script undevelop area make lot charact forgett visual bit uneven music sequenc cast great plenti entertain,0.984,0.306,0.123,0.571,Positive

"Disney's Snow White is a complete disaster. The acting is terrible, with Gal Gadot delivering one of the worst performances of her career. She simply cannot act. The film strays so far from the original story that it barely resembles the classic tale. Instead of a faithful adaptation, we get a soulless, misguided attempt at modernization. The visuals are uninspired, the writing is weak, and the CGI looks awful. Even Dragon Ball Evolution was better.

"This is one of the worst live action adaptations in history. Its script butchers the original story with unnecessary changes and a clumsily forced message.

"Disney's Snow White fails to live up to expectations both in storytelling and execution. From weak 2025 CGI and uninspired performances to a lack of emotional depth, the movie struggles to justify its existence. The casting controversy surrounding Rachel Zegler set a negative tone before release, and unfortunately, the film itself does little to redeem it. The dwarfs' CGI is unimpressive, the plot lacks cohesion, and the performances, despite a strong cast, feel flat.

"Ouch! Now this was always going to be a difficult story to imaginatively reimagine, and I do wonder just who Disney thought this was for as it quite radically alters the timeless fairy tale and augments it with some remarkably unremarkable power ballads and set piece choreography that wouldn't have looked out of place at a barn dance. This iteration of the story pretty much abandons the fantasy elements of the original one and tells us of a wicked queen who has tricked her way onto the throne and turned the princess ""Snow White"" (Rachel Zegler) into something more akin to a royal ""Cinderella"". Luckily for her, she encounters the enthusiastic bandit ""Jonathan"" (Andrew Burnap) who has broken into the palace to pinch some spuds, and next thing they are both trying to stay one step ahead of the Queen (Gal Gadot) who is narked by her mirror telling her she's just plain ugly so she wants them deceased! It does swing by the brothers Grimm every now and again, and there are seven singing dwarves to ""work the whole day long"", but even they can't breathe much life into this surprisingly mundane exercise in superb technical creativity but otherwise lacklustre amateur stage theatricals. The unmistakably familiar score from Messrs. Pasek and Paul keeps threatening to break into ""You Will Be Found"" from ""Dear Evan Hansen"" and aside from, perhaps, ""Waiting on a Wish"" the soundtrack - like the whole thing - is disappointingly forgettable as it avoids every potential hint of menace progressing through a fondue of gloop towards it's conclusion. Thank heavens for ""Grumpy"" (Martin Kleppa) who is probably the only one on-screen in synch with those of us watching. If you do want to see it then cinema is definitely best.

"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so astoundingly awful, so fundamentally broken, that you wonder how anyone involved thought it was a good idea. Snow White (2024) isn't just bad-it's an unwatchable, soulless, insult to cinema. This isn't a movie; it's a dumpster fire set ablaze by Disney's own arrogance and creative bankruptcy.

A Character Assassination of Snow White The original Snow White was a timeless classic with a kind-hearted heroine. This version? A smug, bitter, self-righteous shell of a character who lacks any warmth or charm. Rachel Zegler's performance is as grating as her off-screen comments about how much she despises the original film. Instead of a fairy tale princess, we get a condescending know-it-all who sneers at the very idea of romance, heroism, or anything remotely resembling a compelling story arc.

The ""Dwarfs"" - Or Whatever They Are In what can only be described as one of the worst creative decisions in cinematic history, Disney removed the iconic Seven Dwarfs and replaced them with... a random group of people with no personality, no chemistry, and no reason to exist. They're so forgettable that calling them ""characters"" feels generous. It's like they grabbed a bunch of extras from a failed Netflix show and told them to stand around in the background.

A CGI Catastrophe Visually, Snow White (2024) is an absolute eyesore. The special effects look unfinished, the cinematography is flat and lifeless, and the color grading makes everything look like it was filmed through a dirty window. The original film from 1937-hand-drawn frame by frame-has more life, beauty, and artistry than this entire multimillion-dollar disaster.

Disney's Most Boring Movie Ever If this film had any redeeming qualities-funny moments, an emotional core, or even decent action-it might at least be watchable. But there's nothing. The script is atrocious, the pacing is a disaster, and the entire movie is so lifeless that it feels like a punishment to sit through. Every scene drags on with awkward dialogue and dull performances, making Snow White feel like a two-hour endurance test.

Final Verdict: A Career-Ending Disaster Snow White (2024) isn't just the worst Disney remake-it might be the worst thing the studio has ever produced. It's an insult to the original, a disaster of storytelling, and proof that modern Disney has lost every shred of creativity. Avoid this mess at all costs.

"This refreshed live action version of Snow White still brings in the nostalgia of some the songs and characters we remember from the animated film but modernizes it. While the movie has a bit more adventure it still holds it charm and adorable characters, just like the classic you remember!

The film does a good job of explaining the relationship between the evil Queen and Snow White. As simply touched in the original film, more time is spent on backstory of what happened to Cinderella's parents and the Queen's ability to put up with Snow White...well, until she doesn't.

A reimagining Seven Dwarfs and Snow White's love interest is refreshing. Oh, they even remembered to incorporate Snow White's loving forrest animals who are by her side, just like in the original. What is a nice bonus is they added some action/adventure in the film while empowering Snow White. No longer is Snow White just the victim or a character that needs saving, Snow White becomes the hero of her own story (with the help of others). This new twist is a good way to empower younger audiences while still letting Snow White choose good to conquer evil.

"We gave it a shot-my entire family sat down genuinely hoping Snow White (2025) would be worth the time. It wasn't. The film is an unwatchable mess, a complete butchering of the original story that seems more focused on making a statement than telling a coherent tale. It abandons everything that made the classic beloved, replacing heart and imagination with awkward messaging and shallow characters. The visuals are equally disastrous. The animation quality is shockingly poor for a modern production; I've seen more polished work from indie studios over a decade ago. Worse, it's visually inconsistent-flipping between cartoonish slapstick and jarring attempts at hyper-realism, leaving the viewer confused about what kind of world this is supposed to be. There's no magic here, just a clumsy, soulless product that doesn't seem to know what audience it's even aiming for. This was the final straw for me.

"Worst movie ever. Story was incredibly changed , and her acting was awful throughout the movie . Gal gadot is the only reason to watch the movie . Still the movie is too cringy ...!

Snow White is supposed to be a kind, gentle, and lovable character, but Zegler's version comes across as arrogant and unlikable.

This version distances itself so far from the heart of the original that it ends up feeling hollow and confused, disappointing both long-time fans and newcomers.

The biggest issue at the heart of this film is a complete disregard for what made the original beloved. Instead of embracing the magic, innocence, and simple charm of the original classic, this version seems almost embarrassed by its own source material.

I've seen all the other Snow White movies and unfortunately as much as I like Gal Godot she didn't hold a candle to Charlize Theron in her portrayal, maybe she shouldn't have tried a musical. In fact I think this movie was more musical theatre than a big screen film. I felt like they may have spent the majority of the budget to get Gal to do the movie, she didn't have a huge amount of lines and what she did have she over acted in them.

The female lead playing Snow White was a great actress but I also think it was just rubbish directing and and musical theatre

The story was odd, think of Snow White, the seven dwarves and Robin and his merry men. It was hard to watch. Like I said, if I was a 10 year old girl I probably would have loved it.

"I approached the film with low expectations, but what awaited me there undercut even these. This film is not just a failed remake - it is a prime example of how to distort a timeless classic beyond recognition. The magic of the original has been replaced by sterile images, lifeless acting and a plot that is clearly ashamed of its own identity.

Rachel Zegler as Snow White comes across as consistently distant, almost as if she doesn't believe in the story she's telling. Her performance lacks warmth, and any form of charisma is sorely missing. And while her voice has potential, the songs remain pale and forgettable the moment they fade. The musical magic of the original? Gone without a trace.

Gal Gadot, who visually fits the role of the Evil Queen without question, delivers a performance that swings between overacted pathos and emotionless routine. She's neither frightening nor fascinating - just completely out of place. Her scenes feel more like a fashion campaign with dialogue than a film performance.

What shocked me most was the visual execution. Despite the enormous budget, the film looks like an overlong commercial from post-production hell. The CGI depiction of the ""dwarfs"" (if we're even allowed to call them that anymore) is so artificial, I felt secondhand embarrassment. These figures have neither charm nor personality - they are mere digital shadows of once-beloved characters.

But the film's biggest flaw lies in its core attitude: instead of developing the story or respectfully reinterpreting it, it goes out of its way to distance itself from the original - and in doing so, completely loses its emotional core. The romantic component is sacrificed for ideological reasons without offering anything of equal value in return. What remains is a narrative that neither moves nor inspires.

Throughout the entire runtime, I kept asking myself why this film even exists. Anyone who loves the original should avoid this soulless product at all costs.

Rather than capturing the magic and charm of the classic, it strips away everything that made the original so beloved and replaces it with poorly executed changes.

"The recent Snow White remake, unfortunately, falls short of capturing the charm and heart of the original Disney classic. While it attempts to modernize the story, the film seems to prioritize contemporary themes over the fundamental aspects that made the original tale so beloved.

One of the main issues with this remake is its shift in focus from Snow White's personal growth and her relationships with the dwarfs to more modern, preachy themes about independence and self-reliance. These themes feel forced and detract from the emotional core of the story. The original Snow White was a symbol of kindness and resilience, and these qualities are less emphasized here, which makes the character feel less relatable and harder to root for.

The portrayal of Snow White in this version is another point of concern. While the actress delivers her performance with determination, the character's warmth and innocence-key to the original-are largely absent. Instead of an endearing figure, Snow White here feels more like a character shaped by modern ideals rather than the timeless virtues that made her stand out in the classic.

Similarly, the Evil Queen, once a complex and menacing villain, is reduced to a less compelling figure. Her motivations feel unclear, and the character lacks the depth and menace that made her such a memorable antagonist in the original film.

The film's attempt to infuse social commentary into the narrative is another area where it struggles. While it's important for films to reflect societal values, the messages in this remake often feel overly forced, detracting from the story rather than enhancing it. It's clear that the intention was to create a more empowering story, but the execution leaves much to be desired.

Visually, the film is polished and colorful, but its flashy aesthetics can't mask the lack of emotional depth. There's a sense that the filmmakers were more concerned with spectacle than with crafting a story that resonates with audiences on a deeper level.

Ultimately, while this Snow White remake offers a fresh take, it doesn't quite live up to the spirit of the original.

"Just utterly bad and disappointing... what happened to Disney... it is below expectations for a film that reportedly cost more than $270m. Disney, once again, took a classic, wonderful movie and ruined it. I went to see it with my wife and we decided within 30 minutes that we would not take our children. This movie just shows that Disney is losing their creativity. Not to mention the acting is terrible. Why cast someone who doesn't respect the original film? Snow White was worse than I expected. It had no idea what it wanted to be as a movie, and Gal Gadot as the villain struggled with acting capability and failed to establish the necessary intimidating presence required for the role.

"Gal Gadot's as of the Evil Queen in Snow White is, unfortunately, a major misstep. Her performance falls flat in almost every other aspect. Her line delivery lacks the depth and menace needed for such an iconic role, making her character feel more like a cartoonish exaggeration than a truly intimidating force.

One of the biggest issues with Gadot's acting is her emotional range-or lack thereof. Rather than bringing a nuanced, layered villain to life, her performance comes across as forced and unnatural. Instead of exuding an effortless aura of wickedness, her delivery feels stiff and overly rehearsed. The Evil Queen should command the screen with a chilling presence, but Gadot's portrayal feels more like a parody, as if she's trying too hard to be menacing without actually achieving it.

Another glaring flaw is how she handles the dialogue.",1/10,gal gadot evil queen snow white unfortun major misstep perform fall flat almost everi aspect line deliveri lack depth menac need icon role make charact feel like cartoonish exagger truli intimid forc one biggest issu gadot act emot lack thereof rather bring nuanc layer villain life perform come across forc unnatur instead exud effortless aura wicked deliveri feel stiff overli rehears evil queen command screen chill presenc gadot portray feel like parodi tri hard menac without actual achiev anoth glare flaw handl dialogu,-0.9501,0.05,0.216,0.734,Negative

"First, let me quote Ansu Kabia's review: >That the audience for **Ari Aster**'s folk horror might find more pleasure in this Snow White than the average child is telling, since it's almost impossible to work out who this version of the story is aimed at. Children will be bored, teens talked down to, and most adults will wonder where their Snow White is.

Exactly. Who is the target audience of this movie, I couldn't discern. Perhaps the so-called theatre kids, but definitely not kids or adults. Here's my full review: * First, ***SUBSTANCE***: The tale of** Snow White** is inherently flawed and lacks substance, and despite going rebellious this version couldn't circumvent those weaknesses let alone translating them for better. Worsening on the other hand, well... * Now, ***VISUALS***? Too vibrant and glistening. The CGI is the biggest enemy in here because it's not disguised properly, and I'm not even going to talk about the catastrophe, that is the thing that happened with little people. The forest, animals, all those wooden houses, kingdom, grass, trees, plant - they are cartoonish, imagine how the special effects looked during ***Lord of the Rings***' era and then increase the saturation and contrast - that bad. It's flabbergasting that they did not go with the darker visuals as seen in the **1937 version** where no flamboyant yellow and green was needed. I take it they wanted to push some kind of ""joy"" based agenda here... I don't know. But the effects don't even match ***Beauty and the Beast*** and that thing came out 8 yrs ago. Maybe, Disney really isn't lying about the budget; maybe the budget really is under $300 million.

* Next ***ACTING***: **Rachel Zegler** can sing alright, and that's the only thing I can find positive to say about her. She's clearly s theater actress and the melodrama shows and gets annoying. That hairstyle isn't helping, and of course, the dress of Snow White makes her appear worse somehow. It's inexplicable, yet conspicuous. **Gal Gadot**, on the other hand, is really not given adequate character. She's an average actress, something we have known all along, but this appearance in here was laughably bad.

* Finally, ***STORY & DIRECTION***: The sloppy themes of leadership are laughable and you can clearly see **Greta Gerwig**'s work there, who was later replaced. Like ***Barbie***, this film go to extreme lengths to reiterate that ***Snow White*** would be a better leader, like Barbies and women in *Barbie*, but like that film it never corroborates that fact by answering ""why would that be?"" We have seen grittier version in ***Snow White and the Huntsman***, and honestly even that was not this bad. The problem is again these visuals and all the musical numbers really not helping.

Lastly, a note to director **Marc Webb**: i love your work in '***The Amazing Spider-Man***' franchise and I loved '***500 Days of Summer***' and I appreciated '***Gifted***,' but you need to stay away from reboots. People weren't happy with *TASM* coming out even though it was a brilliantly darker retelling, but '***Snow White***' just isn't it.

Of course, what's done is done, but let's not remake '***Kimi no Na Wa***.' okay, that thing is too knew for remakes, anyways, and Hollywood's butchery will not sit well there. If you thought this so-called ""right-wing"" backlash was bad, you ain't seen anime fans' fury yet.

So yeah, ***Snow White*** = not worth a watch, hype, or budget; hate and boycott on the other hand...

"CGI Dwarfs: A Paradox of Technical Showmanship and Emotional Disconnect The film replaces the iconic seven dwarfs with cartoonish CGI-generated figures, a decision widely condemned as a ""grotesque patchwork of cultural industry clichés"" .Worse, the dwarfs' design-trapped in an unsettling ""human-but-not-human"" limbo-erases the endearing whimsy of their animated counterparts. Over-reliance on flashy effects (e.g., ""magic-hour lighting"") further cheapens their presence, rendering them visually artificial. This obsession with technology reflects Disney's fundamental misunderstanding: the dwarfs are not mere fairy-tale tropes but vessels of humanized emotion. CGI's overuse strips them of this vital connection.

Snow White's flaws reflect Disney's recurring sins in live-action remakes: prioritizing technological spectacle and forced modern messaging over storytelling. When the magic mirror struggles to name ""the fairest,"" Disney should ask itself: true magic lies not in CGI dazzle but in reigniting the pure emotional resonance of fairy tales.

"The heart of any Snow White adaptation is, of course, Snow White herself. In the original animated film, she was kind, optimistic, and full of warmth, making it easy to root for her. In this new version, however, Snow White is completely stripped of her innocence and replaced with an unlikeable, self-righteous protagonist who lacks any real character development. Instead of embodying the classic fairytale princess that audiences have loved for generations, this version of Snow White is written to be a modern, independent heroine-but it's done so clumsily that she comes off as arrogant rather than inspiring.

Her journey feels forced rather than organic, and the film goes out of its way to dismantle her traditional story without offering anything compelling in return.

"This movie looks haphazardly thrown together, almost as though they tried to mash three different films shot in three different ways together (which they probably did with all the reshoots).

"Disney's live-action Snow White is a disastrous misstep, failing on nearly every front. The film's attempt to modernize the classic story results in a muddled and uninspired narrative, with changes that feel forced rather than meaningful. Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the charm and warmth of the original, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen delivers an underwhelming and wooden performance.

Visually, the film is equally disappointing. The CGI dwarfs are unsettling, the overuse of digital effects makes everything feel artificial, and the production design lacks the magical quality that made the animated version timeless. The musical numbers, including the new songs, are forgettable and lifeless, failing to capture the spirit of the original score.

Saw it today with my littles (14, 8, 3) and a friend/their kids (7, 3) and we all enjoyed it.

The songs were great. The singing was fantastic. The nostalgia was there. The changes made sense.

The worst part was the CGI - the dwarves were weird looking and so were some of the forest creatures.

There wasn't much back story to the evil queen, which could have been fun.

"This movie is a perfect example of how not to remake a classic. The film strips away everything that made the original special its charm, heart, and magic, replacing it with a dull, soulless attempt at modernization.

The CGI dwarfs look unnatural, the changes to the story feel forced, and the visuals, while expensive, lack the warmth of classic Disney animation. Even Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, which should have been a highlight, feels underwhelming.

The heart and magic that made the original ""Snow White"" timeless seem completely missing in this version.

"Rachel Zegler is one of the great up-and-coming (if not in some aspects ""already arrived"") song-and-dance-picture stars. Her casting as live-action Snow White is as savvy as Emma Watson's Belle in the similar Beauty and the Beast. Unfortunately, Zegler's talent and charm is about all Snow White has going for it, as it runs into all the same problems as so many of the Disney live-action remakes before it.

For a very basic overview, Snow White tells the iconic tale of the titular princess (Zegler) who is pursued by her evil Queen stepmother (Gal Gadot) and finds refuge both with the enigmatic Seven Dwarves and a rebel named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap).

Again: Zegler is a true standout here. The top moments of this movie are her reprising Whistle While You Work and contributing the original song Princess Problems. In those moments, one can understand why this project was greenlit-because they contain some charm.

Alas, Snow White suffers-like the long line of recent Disney animation remakes before it-from the ""why is this necessary?"" and the ""balance between new/old"" problems. The 1937 original ushered in Disney's reign of animation/musical dominance and this one obviously can't hold a candle to that in scope/spectre. So, director Marc Webb tries to infuse some new material-only to have it be an odd mix trying to weave it in with the classic bits.

Of course, Disney's own petty political panderings hurt this production too. Casting real actors as the Seven Dwarves would have made this a more fun/unique experience-but the Mouse House got rattled by a ridiculous ""dwarfism"" controversy and instead went with dwarf-animation. An asinine choice considering the '37 animation in that department is one of Disney's most iconic properties.

So, overall, I view 2025's Snow White as a great resume-builder for Rachel Zegler-and that's about it. This is a movie absolutely screaming to be liked (who doesn't enjoy a magical fairy tale?!) and only Zegler provides a few of those moments.

"In Snow White, the contrast between the performances of the main villain and the protagonist is striking. The Evil Queen's portrayal comes off as overly dramatic and lacks the nuance that could have made her a more compelling character. The acting feels forced, monotoned, and the villain often comes across as one-dimensional seemingly from acting alone lol which detracts from the overall tension and engagement of the story.

On the other hand, Snow White herself delivers a commendable performance. Zegler brings warmth and charm to the character, effectively embodying the innocence and kindness that define her. However, despite her strong acting, the script fails to provide her with meaningful dialogue or character development.

"I saw it for free, so thankfully I didn't have to spend funds. Don't spend funds to see this. It is not worth the film it's shot on. I will say Rachel has a very good singing voice.

There's been so much controversy over this movie in the past few months and I'll say this, casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White was not the biggest problem in this. No, there's loads of them.

The story itself has changed, the CGI Dwarfs look terrible, Gal Gadot is beyond hot and somehow Rachel Zegler is supposed to be prettier? The idea of the seven members of the thief's party might have originally been supposed to be stand ins for the Seven Dwarfs... oh sorry ""magical creatures"". And what's their magic? They touch the gems in the cave and they glow. Ooooh! Special.

Then there's the fact it's not a love story. The original is about the handsome prince kissing her to wake her up. Now it's she learns to be the leader she always was meant to be.

Most disappointing is how the film loses sight of the heart and wonder of the original story. Instead of embracing the timeless themes of love, kindness, and bravery, it pushes a narrative that feels disconnected from what made Snow White a beloved tale in the first place.

"Snow White (2024) is a disappointing and unnecessary remake that completely misses the charm and magic of the original. Instead of honoring the classic, the film feels like a forced reimagining that lacks heart and substance. The writing is uninspired, the characters feel flat, and the changes to the story seem more like an attempt to make a statement rather than enhance the narrative. Snow White herself is unrecognizable, stripped of the qualities that made her an iconic character. The removal of the dwarfs, a crucial part of the original story, only makes the film feel emptier. On top of that, the CGI-heavy visuals fail to capture the fairy tale atmosphere, making everything look artificial and lifeless.

"Disney's Snow White is already controversial, but Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen makes it even worse. She looks the part, but the second she speaks, the illusion is shattered. Her stiff delivery, awkward line reading, and complete lack of menace make her less of a fearsome villain and more of a campy cartoon. Instead of exuding power, she feels like she's playing dress-up. A good villain should be chilling, but Gadot's Evil Queen is just embarrassing. This casting choice proves that not every big-name star is suited for every role.

"I would rate the Snow White movie a 1 because it completely strays from the essence of the original story in an attempt to be overly inclusive. While diversity in films is important, it should not come at the cost of erasing key elements that define a classic tale.

One of the biggest issues is that the film excludes real dwarfs, replacing them with average-sized actors. This is not only unfair to little people who could have had a significant opportunity in Hollywood, but it also removes an essential part of the traditional Snow White narrative. The original fairy tale is deeply rooted in the story of Snow White and the seven dwarfs-altering this takes away from its authenticity.",1/10,would rate snow white movi complet stray essenc origin stori attempt overli inclus divers film import come cost eras key element defin classic tale one biggest issu film exclud real dwarf replac actor unfair littl peopl could signific opportun hollywood also remov essenti part tradit snow white narr origin fairi tale deepli root stori snow white seven take away authent,-0.4767,0.0,0.05,0.95,Negative

"Snow White (2025) A reimagining of Disney's fairy tale into a live-action version filled with vision and a modern perspective, while firmly retaining the framework of the original Grimm fairy tale.

The storytelling focuses on the development of the main characters, particularly Snow White and the Evil Queen, giving them greater depth than the original. While preserving the romantic and dreamy essence of a fairy tale, it cleverly incorporates elements of power struggles and personal identity.

Rachel Zegler plays Snow White with a beautiful voice and strong performance, portraying a character who embodies both gentleness and resilience.

Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen exudes allure and cruelty, delivering a chilling performance that leaves an impression. However, her role lacks the intensity it deserves, missing the fearfulness and mystique expected from the character.

The visuals are crafted with stunning beauty and imagination, reflecting the essence of a fairy tale. The fantasy world is breathtaking, with vibrant colors and intricate details, especially in the forest scenes and lively animals.

The soundtrack remains a highlight of Disney. The music seamlessly blends classic songs with new melodies, particularly the standout track ""Waiting on a Wish."" The classic ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" is reimagined in a modern, melodious way.

However, the screenplay has noticeable weaknesses. Some parts of the story lack deep emotional pull, and supporting characters are underdeveloped. The seven dwarfs are adorable but have overly limited roles.

The first half of the film captivates with its visuals and emotions, but the second half loses balance with rushed pacing. The ending feels overly simplistic, leaving a sense of disappointment.

Snow White (2025) blends classic elements with contemporary flair and a fresh interpretation in a satisfying way. It may not reach its full potential, but it's a film that both fans of the classic and newer audiences can enjoy.

Score: 9/10 Despite initial negative opinions about Rachel Zegler, after watching the film, I must admit her acting and singing skills are impressive.

"Three stars solely for Gal Gadot. She is stunning and does the Disney-baddie acting perfectly: corny lines, dance number and all.

The casting of Snow White is a disaster. Rather than tall, fair, graceful and beautiful we get this person that is really bland. Not too be mean but she is just clearly not suitable for the role.

The feigned warmth just comes across as annoying and tedious. And of course the romance is gone - replace by some idea that Snow White is to be a leader of the kingdom and queen.

It is all too predictable and just sad to see. Why do we have to stand with these ""modern"" approaches to classical tales.

"Of all the Disney animated classics, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" might just be the least necessary one to remake. It's the most iconic, yet ironically, the one with the weakest emotional connection to modern audiences.

The original 1937 animated film is so old that most people either don't remember the actual plot or have never bothered to watch it at all. For most, ""Snow White"" lives on as vague cultural shorthand - a poisoned apple, a magic mirror, ""Hi Ho,"" and that's about it. Unlike the Disney Renaissance films (Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast), which still have songs people sing in the shower, ""Snow White's"" music barely registers anymore. It's a relic.

Another reason this remake felt unnecessary is Disney's self-imposed creative straitjacket. When Disney remakes ""Snow White"", they're not reimagining the classic fairy tale. They're remaking ""their own version"" of the story.

This gives Disney a competitive advantage but also creates a significant handicap. The advantage? Disney's animated ""Snow White"" is so culturally dominant that people often mistakenly think they invented the tale. This monopoly on the cultural memory of ""Snow White"" gives Disney an unparalleled level of brand loyalty - other studios can release ""their"" versions of ""Snow White"", but they'll just feel like ""yet another ""Snow White"" movie."" When Disney does it, it's ""The"" ""Snow White"" movie. It's an event. You don't want to ignore it.

The disadvantage? Disney can't stray too far from their original animated film. They ""have"" to keep the look and feel of their version intact to preserve their cultural dominance. Reinventing the wheel would risk alienating fans who expect the movie to ""feel like Disney."" So instead of daring, bold reimaginings like ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (a horror take), ""Mirror Mirror"" (a campy comedy), or ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (dark action fantasy), Disney gives us a watered-down rehash that feels as bland as it is redundant.

It's clear Disney believed that the only way to turn ""Snow White"" into another billion-dollar juggernaut was to stick to the formula. After all, it worked for ""The Lion King"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Aladdin"". Why mess with success? Those previous remakes were soulless cash grabs too, but they made money, so Disney stuck to the plan.

Unfortunately, they didn't anticipate that their one bold casting choice - the decision to feature a Latina actress as Snow White - would blow up so spectacularly in their faces.

Disney's live-action strategy relies heavily on nostalgia, but it's nostalgia dressed up in shiny packaging. The studio markets these movies as comforting throwbacks with just enough tweaks to feel ""fresh."" But in reality, these tweaks are often superficial, half-hearted, and inconsistent. ""Snow White"" is no exception.

The film is filled with Disney's usual sins: slavish devotion to the animated original (to the point of absurdity), awkward attempts to modernize certain aspects of the story, and an overall lack of creativity. The result is a movie that feels like it's trying to justify its own existence and failing miserably.

Take the visuals, for instance. Disney insists on preserving the look of the original film, but without any thought as to ""Why"" these design choices made sense in the first place. The costumes and set design feel less like ""classic fairy tale"" and more like ""theme park cosplay."" By comparison, ""Mirror Mirror's"" whimsical costumes fit the film's comedic tone, and ""Snow White and the Huntsman's"" gritty aesthetic matched its dark, action-packed vibe. Disney's live-action ""Snow White"", on the other hand, feels like it only exists to sell merchandise.

The story fares no better. Disney knows it needs to flesh out the characters and make their relationships more believable, but it never fully commits to these changes. For example, the Evil Queen's jealousy of Snow White is still mostly about beauty, with only a vague suggestion of political ambition. Meanwhile, the Huntsman's moral dilemma about killing Snow White is staged so awkwardly that it feels like a bad high school play. The actors do their best, but the scene is so stilted and out of place that it's almost painful to watch.

Perhaps the most glaring issue is the Evil Queen herself. Gal Gadot is, without question, the worst Evil Queen in cinematic history. And no, I'm not exaggerating. Let's be real: the only reason she was cast is because of her looks. Sure, she's gorgeous, but when you're following in the footsteps of Sigourney Weaver (Snow White: A Tale of Terror), Julia Roberts (Mirror Mirror), and Charlize Theron (Snow White and the Huntsman), looking pretty isn't enough. Those actresses brought elegance, menace, and depth to the role. Gadot? She brought... eyebrow wiggling and ""constipated villain face."" Every time she tried to emote, I felt secondhand embarrassment. Her singing? Let's just say it sounded so autotuned, I wasn't sure if it was even her voice.

To be fair, this is probably her least embarrassing performance since ""Wonder Woman 1984"". At least she managed to hit the basic beats of ""scheming and evil,"" even if it felt like she'd just learned the concept from an acting coach five minutes before filming. But honestly, Disney could've thrown a dart at a list of actresses, and anyone it hit would've been better than Gadot.

On the flip side, Rachel Zegler - the controversial choice for Snow White - is the film's one saving grace. Hate her all you want, but the girl can act, sing, and dance circles around anyone else in this movie. Her performance is effortlessly charismatic, with a radiant charm that lights up every scene she's in. You can criticize her all you want on Twitter, but her talent is undeniable. There's a reason industry legends like Rita Moreno have called her a ""triple threat"" - she's the real deal.

Zegler's musical numbers in this film are mesmerizing. She knows how to act through a song, weaving emotion into every note and gesture. Even her much-mocked expressions during ""Waiting on a Wish"" (yes, I've seen the memes) are a masterclass in theatricality. If you went into this movie determined to hate her, that's on you. But if you're willing to set aside the internet hate train for a moment, you might actually see why she's one of the most exciting young talents in Hollywood.

At the end of the day, Disney's live-action ""Snow White"" is exactly what you'd expect: a mediocre cash grab with a few fleeting moments of brilliance (courtesy of Zegler). It's not the worst thing Disney's ever made, but it's certainly not worth the hype. For me, it's just another soulless remake that exists more to sell toys than to tell a compelling story.

If you loved Disney's ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"" remakes, you might enjoy this one too. But if you're tired of Disney serving up reheated leftovers and calling it a feast, you're better off skipping this one.",4/10,disney anim classic snow white seven dwarf might least necessari one remak icon yet iron one weakest emot connect modern audienc origin anim film old peopl either rememb actual plot never bother watch snow white life vagu cultur shorthand poison appl magic mirror hi ho unlik disney renaiss film aladdin lion king beauti beast still song peopl sing shower snow white music bare regist anymor relic anoth reason remak felt unnecessari disney creativ straitjacket disney remak snow white reimagin classic fairi tale remak version stori give disney competit advantag also creat signific handicap advantag disney anim snow white cultur domin peopl often mistakenli think invent tale monopoli cultur memori snow white give disney unparallel level brand loyalti studio releas version snow white feel like yet anoth snow white movi disney snow white movi event want ignor disadvantag disney ca stray far origin anim film keep look feel version intact preserv cultur domin reinvent wheel would risk alien fan expect movi feel like disney instead dare bold reimagin like snow white tale terror horror take mirror mirror campi comedi snow white huntsman dark action fantasi disney give u rehash feel bland redund clear disney believ way turn snow white anoth juggernaut stick formula work lion king beauti beast aladdin mess success previou remak soulless cash grab made money disney stuck plan unfortun anticip one bold cast choic decis featur latina actress snow white would blow spectacularli face disney strategi reli heavili nostalgia nostalgia dress shini packag studio market movi comfort throwback enough tweak feel fresh realiti tweak often superfici inconsist snow white except film fill disney usual sin slavish devot anim origin point absurd awkward attempt modern certain aspect stori overal lack creativ result movi feel like tri justifi exist fail miser take visual instanc disney insist preserv look origin film without thought design choic made sens first place costum set design feel less like classic fairi tale like theme park cosplay comparison mirror mirror whimsic costum fit film comed tone snow white huntsman gritti aesthet match dark vibe disney snow white hand feel like exist sell merchandis stori fare better disney know need flesh charact make relationship believ never fulli commit chang exampl evil queen jealousi snow white still mostli beauti vagu suggest polit ambit meanwhil huntsman moral dilemma kill snow white stage awkwardli feel like bad high school play actor best scene stilt place almost pain watch perhap glare issu evil queen gal gadot without question worst evil queen cinemat histori exagger let real reason cast look sure gorgeou follow footstep sigourney weaver snow white tale terror julia robert mirror mirror charliz theron snow white huntsman look pretti enough actress brought eleg menac depth role gadot brought eyebrow wiggl constip villain face everi time tri emot felt secondhand embarrass sing let say sound autotun sure even voic fair probabl least embarrass perform sinc wonder woman least manag hit basic beat scheme evil even felt like learn concept act coach five minut film honestli disney could thrown dart list actress anyon hit would better gadot flip side rachel zegler controversi choic snow white film one save grace hate want girl act sing danc circl around anyon els movi perform effortlessli charismat radiant charm light everi scene critic want twitter talent undeni reason industri legend like rita moreno call tripl threat real deal zegler music number film mesmer know act song weav emot everi note gestur even express wait wish ye seen meme masterclass theatric went movi determin hate will set asid internet hate train moment might actual see one excit young talent hollywood end day disney snow white exactli expect mediocr cash grab fleet moment brillianc courtesi zegler worst thing disney ever made certainli worth hype anoth soulless remak exist sell toy tell compel stori love disney lion king beauti beast remak might enjoy one tire disney serv reheat leftov call feast better skip one,0.8985,0.152,0.121,0.727,Positive

This remake is terrible. Everything is obviously fake and there is nothing magical about Snow White talking to bad CGI dwarves and animals. The changes to the story were cliche and weak.

Some strong points were when the wicked queen appeared as an old hag to give Snow White the poison apple and she fell and the apple rolled from her hand. That is a direct scene from the original. The ""hag"" and apple were great and the fall was great photography. But again, why is it needed? We don't need to recreate something in attempt to match it's cinematic perfection from earlier.

"LIKES: Animation For Animals Costume/Makeup Some Dialogue Well-Written/Delivered Some Good Emotional Moments Musical Level Songs Cute/Cuddly/Disney Modern Voice Acting Is Good For Me Solid Messages.

Summary: Despite the masses calling for the head of Snow White, I found a few things I think were done well in this film. We start with the voice acting and the cast that brings it to life when it comes to the dwarves and the magic mirror. Though not as strong as the original seven, I liked the new group very much and found their techniques quite fitting for the live-action make. They embody the personalities well and add that fantasy element Disney is very efficient at making but still holds more emotion than much of the non-digital cast. These guys are the ones who deliver some of the better dialogue, a few of the live-action cast managed to drop some really powerful lines at just the right moment that will make it on the quote boards. I found those quotes often in those very heartfelt moments where everything came together, some inflections of the Disney magic sparkling the way they did in the 1900s and delivering those solid messages of kindness, fairness, and hard work to solve problems.

Where most of the splendor came for me in the movie is the visual effects that capture that Disney cuddliness we know the company for holding. The costumes and makeup are solid rebuilds of the cartoon design, many of them authentic nods to the times but pop with a bit of modern sheen for future cosplays. Sure, some of the costumes look a little cheaper than others, but overall, it is a better portrayal of the character than other facets. I enjoyed the songs to some degree, with a very Broadway musical ambiance radiating from them as Snow sings her way through the opening numbers and dances about with the town in new songs that Disney continues to spin out. The older numbers are very fun as well, not quite as Mystical Melody as in the past, but still holding that fun charm that I remember from the film, but could have used some more finesse and planning to be memorable. Finally, the animation for the animals was something I found to be my favorite aspect of this movie. Like Enchanted, Snow White's live adaptation puts a lot of gorgeous detail into the animals, keeping much of their physiology with just a touch of the human element to add that adorable energy to give them their own tertiary personalities. They play a rather large part in the movie, and it helps add Disney family-friendly charm for the younger audience members that modern Disney continues to keep in their films and should be enjoyable to the masses.

DISLIKES Plot Is Messy Too Many Characters CGI Design Is Meh for Most Wasted Wicked Queen Boring/Lacking Stakes The Dance Numbers Are All The Same Unnecessary Musicals Lacking Full Punch Conflicting Story Arcs Predictable/Tries Too Hard One Of The Weakest Climactic Endings A Victim of Edits and Media Summary: That's where the likes end, unfortunately. Snow White's live remake comes with several dislikes that I feel are going to be ill-received by audiences, given what I saw. One of the biggest weaknesses for me was the new plot. Sure, the origin of her name is a bit eye-rolling, but Snow White's new tale is trying to be too many things at once and do too many arcs in a compressed time. Snow White's desire to get outside the castle is not such a simple tale as we are introduced to bandits, dwarves, more of huntsmen, evil queens, and new desires for the protagonist. The film is loaded with way too many characters, and I don't really have time to learn most of their names or stories before jumping back into another facet of this movie. The writers struggled to pick lanes and stay in them, and their plot intertwining is very messy and knotted up with frayed transitions. I found it difficult to get tied to any of the characters, none of them packing that same punch outside a few moments nor as well-layered as I know Disney can do. Even the Wicked Queen is very wasted, an antagonist with such potential drowned out by awkward plots and too many arcs competing for dominance. Yet, the worst thing is Snow White's character is too spread thin between the different ""princesses"" she has to be. This new age of remaking the character but keeping to the classic got out of hand, Zegler doing her best to play so many approaches not enough to make this a very inconsistent Snow White I didn't love or hate. When you see that a lot of the live-character actors didn't have the best acting consistency, it only further weakens the strained characters for viewers like me and makes the film boring.

Surely, the spectacle is enough to make up for it, right? I'm sorry to say the answer is no on that one. The dance numbers are charming at times, that musical prowess present in the resonating voices, thundering instruments, and grandiose extensions of notes. However, many of the songs feel very much the same, with reprises and similar-sounding tunes that lack the variety I know Disney to have past their earlier works. The dance numbers also felt very carbon-copy, the same twirls, exchanges, and steps feeling lazy and repetitive shots that pale in comparison to shows like Wicked do so well. Even worse, the movie felt very carefree, where they inserted songs, with many of them feeling shoehorned in to get another track on the playlist. Such haphazard planning doesn't do much for me, especially when each track feels very much the same song. As for the action, this is another Snow White tale that struggles to do much with the action scenes or climatic struggles. This remake makes a show for building up drama, adding suspense with potentially losing characters at any moment before changing their mind. It's a rather safe film, with more marching and shadow work than actual action, making this feel like the second season of House of Dragons. While this is good news for parents who think any conflict is too violent, for those who like more meat to their story, you'll be subjected to some of the most anticlimactic resolutions to the story. A great theme to stick with regarding the messages, but as a spectacle, it is kind of dull in the grand scheme of Disney movies. All of these problems, I think, are due to the media coverage and the edits that came from it taking the changes too far to make a cohesive film.

The VERDICT: I can see the potential of Snow White and some of the modern elements that could have worked. Disney continues to make good visuals and world-crafting tricks, supplies Broadway-like bellows in their tracks, good voice acting for some lines, and plenty of the new cute and cuddly magic that Disney has played well with their stories. That component will make this movie enjoyable for many families to see, especially those with younger children. However, in terms of a cohesive piece, this live-action fails on many levels with its approach to trying too many things in one film. The conflicting nature of Snow White between classic and new was not fun, nor was trying to juggle many characters who weren't necessary and could have spent more time with the dwarves. Much of the acting could do little to save bland characters who had little time to enjoy, and I was bored with the predictable and anticlimactic tales that couldn't get away from the messages. Throw in repetitive song and dance numbers, and you leave me little of that fantastic factor Disney's 2-D animation was known for having. Thus, is this movie a necessity for theater viewing? I don't think it is outside of a field trip or group outing, with your time much better spent watching at home. When I factor in everything, I give Snow White:

"Snow White is a Disney film directed by Marc Webb. I was already at low expectations before I even saw this movie, I tried giving it a chance when I went in theaters. But it still wasn't good. I appreciate the work out into it and I liked the people who were involved in it. The cinematography was excellent and the music was well produced by Benj Pasek & Justin Noble Paul, and the CGI was EXCELLENT! But the story however felt bland and boring, and it some parts felt like they didn't even try. The close-up shots in certain parts of the movie was awkward, and the some of the acting was a bit off. And it still goes to show that sometimes live action isn't better because it will never capture the same feeling as the original. Another problem was that the CGI for the animals felt too cartoony, and I honestly wasn't a big fan of it. And the casting wasn't that great, the elves and queen were well casted and were perfect! But the actress for Snow White was bad, she didn't really look like the original... for me at least. I'm not saying she shouldn't act again, I'm just saying that she wasn't the right one for Snow White. Another thing I should clarify is that I know that the film isn't for me, it's for the younger audience. But a film for kids should also be for the adults/family.

In conclusion, the film failed to live expectations, mediocre acting, and bland story. 4.5/10.",4/10,snow white disney film direct marc webb alreadi low expect even saw movi tri give chanc went theater still good appreci work like peopl involv cinematographi excel music well produc benj pasek justin nobl paul cgi excel stori howev felt bland bore part felt like even tri shot certain part movi awkward act bit still go show sometim live action better never captur feel origin anoth problem cgi anim felt cartooni honestli big fan cast great elf queen well cast perfect actress snow white bad realli look like origin least say act say right one snow white anoth thing clarifi know film younger audienc film kid also conclus film fail live expect mediocr act bland stori,0.9601,0.241,0.104,0.655,Positive

"It was a generally inoffensive but unnecessary remake. The controversies were overstated (making Zegler and her hot takes the most likely culprit in the film's poor numbers). One thing I'm pretty over is the weird direction that all of Disney's songwriting had taken. Some stuff is pretty good (it's all ""technically"" good), but there seems to be a straight line through Jasmine's new song in the Aladdin remake and all the ""girl I'm supposed to be"" songs of pretty much every Disney movie for the last 5-10 years. Disney music just isn't great anymore. I guess I'm in the minority, but I don't LIKE Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting (I know he didn't write these, but his tone has infected everything). It's well done. And I don't like it. And that's how I feel about everything Disney is doing these days. For something to be basically well done and not be likeable seems to be an issue of tone, of trying to appeal to all the wrong instincts while abandoning some of the hallmarks of good storytelling. It's like they're making movies by committee, but the people on the committee don't like movies. Snow White (the movie) was more wholesome than I expected, but the climax wasn't climactic. It was...meh. Almost silly. There just seems to be a cultural influence through Disney lately that runs counter to the lives of the average movie goer, like they don't speak our language anymore. They're speaking over the heads of the public like they're being idealistic, but with ideals that we don't seem to share. Snow White was the least offensive in this regard of any Disney movies of late, but it still feels like something is getting lost in translation, like they're trying to say what they think we want to hear and they still don't understand it. If anything, it feels like the people who work at Disney and make their movies didn't grow up watching Disney movies. They're bringing some other cultural touchstones to bear in a playground that was built by people they don't understand or value, and it shows.",5/10,gener inoffens unnecessari remak controversi overst make zegler hot take like culprit film poor number one thing pretti weird direct disney songwrit taken stuff pretti good technic good seem straight line jasmin new song aladdin remak girl suppos song pretti much everi disney movi last year disney music great anymor guess minor like lin manuel miranda songwrit know write tone infect everyth well done like feel everyth disney day someth basic well done likeabl seem issu tone tri appeal wrong instinct abandon hallmark good storytel like make movi committe peopl committe like movi snow white movi wholesom expect climax climact meh almost silli seem cultur influenc disney late run counter life averag movi goer like speak languag anymor speak head public like idealist ideal seem share snow white least offens regard disney movi late still feel like someth get lost translat like tri say think want hear still understand anyth feel like peopl work disney make movi grow watch disney movi bring cultur touchston bear playground built peopl understand valu show,0.9875,0.258,0.068,0.674,Positive
"I love Disney films, I don't mind the re-branded ones, but they always come out as slightly hollow, and lacking the charm and sense of wonder, which definitely blunders any chances of real success, wonder and even an Imaginary world. Now what Snow White fails to also deliver on the success of the original, this movie was really not that bad though, it did have it's wonderous charm, and a world and nice props and effects, artificial or not, it was lovely and colourful, and the effects for me gave it that spark, that image, that essence of life. Which lacks in many re-makes from the classical tales.

Zeglar, let's start with her. We'll the material wasn't much, but God damn can she act. She can sing, and as Snow White she put on a show for us, she excells in the role, she looks absolutely beutiful in that dress of hers, and whilst the songs weren't as catchy as the original, and the darker tone of the story, her music gave it a real breath of fresh air. And she was amazing in the role, her charm, charisma and notes makes her fun to watch on screen, as she was really something in that role.

Gadot-her role as the evil sorcerer was fine, nothing noteworthy and nothing that tops-the-scales. More or less just sort of their, and doing an alright job, not that awful. Her songs weren't all that cathcy, and the anti-climax was hollow and rushed through, but her performance was mered by her muffling at times, which would distract the audience.

The 7 Dwarfs-Actually, they look Hillarious, the dwarfs lit-up the show with some jokes, Narratives of people and other things. And motives, memories. And the dwarfs lit it light, they were the best part about the film, as when they were on their was magic, their was a sense of freedom, and they were all great to see on screen. Even if they did look like they were on a video game, which was videoooo cool, instead of just cool. Yes, they look absolutely Rediculous, I couldn't stop laughing.

The bad bits would be the longer duration, the props being like a stage play, but this movie really isn't 2.1 BAD, nope more better then you'd expect. The crashing and burning probably is the controversial things which could of been left out. Because the films biggest problem is the fact that it's sometimes too dark for kids, I Don't think the movie really knew it's audience, I'd say ages 10 and Upwards will heavily enjoy or be gutted with it's outcome, but no-way expressively bad.

"After years of controversy, drama, multiple delays and reshoots, the live action remake of the 1937 Disney animated classic, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs, is finally here. Seeing all the never-ending controversies and multiple reshoots, I didn't had high hopes for it and well.........let's just get into the review.

Starting with the positives. I like that they fleshed out Snow White's character more by giving her a proper backstory and an 'I Want' song and Rachel Zegler's luminous performance was easily the part about the movie. Her gorgeous singing and chemistry with the other actors was a delight to watch. Andrew Burnap as Jonathan was a pleasant surprise. He was hilarious and charming and his chemistry with Rachel is great. Out of the dwarfs, Dopey was the highlight and I like that they gave his character more depth and surprise twist. The other dwarfs were fun to watch (not their designs) as well, particularly Doc and Grumpy. The costume design and production design were beautiful, the visuals were whimsical and enchanting particularly the forest and the dwarfs' cottage and the CGI animals looked adorable.

But the movie has some glaring issues that I could not look past such as Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen. Her performance feels so flat, boring and uninteresting and is far inferior to her animated counterpart. Nor is she any good at singing either which is a shame because her solo number ""All Is Fair"" is actually kinda catchy but she just ruins it with her awful singing. It felt like she was just there to serve looks and nothing else. Then there's the CGI dwarfs. Oh my!! They looked so uncanny valley something straight out of the Polar Express animation which was so distracting. The new songs, though decent, do not mesh well with the old-timey tunes of the original and instead feel like generic broadway pop numbers. And the plot feels messy as it is muddled with so many story beats that it kinda falls apart. It seems to have an identity crisis as it tries to follow the original story while incorporating its own plot points instead of faithfully adapting the source material. The love story was very uninspired and lacked depth. There are so many new characters added who serve nothing to the plot (heck some doesn't even have any dialogues) and were completely unnecessary. Despite the runtime being under 2 hours it felt like the movie dragged on particularly during the second half thanks to the pacing.

Overall, Snow White suffers from a messy plot, Gal Gadot's terrible acting and the uncanny CGI dwarfs but Rachel Zegler's luminous performance and the enchanting visuals makes it a serviceable film. Though it certainly isn't the fairest one of all.",5/10,year controversi drama multipl delay reshoot live action remak disney anim classic snow white seven dwarf final see controversi multipl reshoot high hope well let get review start posit like flesh snow white charact give proper backstori want song rachel zegler lumin perform easili part movi gorgeou sing chemistri actor delight watch andrew burnap jonathan pleasant surpris hilari charm chemistri rachel great dwarf dopey highlight like gave charact depth surpris twist dwarf fun watch design well particularli doc grumpi costum design product design beauti visual whimsic enchant particularli forest dwarf cottag cgi anim look ador movi glare issu could look past gal gadot portray evil queen perform feel flat bore uninterest far inferior anim counterpart good sing either shame solo number fair actual kinda catchi ruin aw sing felt like serv look noth els cgi dwarf oh look uncanni valley someth straight polar express anim distract new song though decent mesh well tune origin instead feel like gener broadway pop number plot feel messi muddl mani stori beat kinda fall apart seem ident crisi tri follow origin stori incorpor plot point instead faith adapt sourc materi love stori uninspir lack depth mani new charact ad serv noth plot heck even dialogu complet unnecessari despit runtim hour felt like movi drag particularli second half thank pace overal snow white suffer messi plot gal gadot terribl act uncanni cgi dwarf rachel zegler lumin perform enchant visual make servic film though certainli fairest one,0.9817,0.209,0.094,0.697,Positive

The dwarfs were CGI, I get it but it really wasn't that bad. Dopey was an absolutely wonderful character and the way Rachel Ziegler was able to interact with them must have been quite difficult.

"Ok, so i watched the Snow White remake out of curiosity with my little niece (not a fan in general of these remakes that Disney keeps churning out) and... it's just ok, nothing else.

Let's start with the positives: Rachel Zegler gives her all with the material she's been given (especially her enjoyable rendition of ""Whistle While You Work"" that was delightful), the set design is gorgeous and some of the songs aren't that bad.

But unfortunately, i have to talk about the negatives: the plot is a jumbled mess, the changes made to the original story are unnecessary, the abysmal CGI (ESPECIALLY the Seven Dwarves that reach uncanny valley territory!) and a complete miscast of the villain played by Gal Gadot: she doesn't strike me at all as the bad guy, her performance & singing voice are so over-the-top and goofy that it's hard being invested in her, especially compared to the original which was one of the best villains in movie history (then again, the screenplay did not help her at all)

"Amid several controversies and a troubled production, the latest Snow White live-action adaptation is finally out, and the verdict is this film is quite...average. Controversies about her casting aside, Rachel Zegler delivers a fine performance and basically carries the movie on her shoulders (and unlike another thespian I'll mention shortly, this girl can actually act). The story was changed in a few key parts, but still falls short of the magic of the 1937 original. Among the most jarring decisions, creating the dwarves using CGI so they resemble their animated counterparts was the worst of all, rendering an uncanny valley appearance which could be easily resolved by hiring seven actual little people for the job. And the other awful aspect was the casting of Gal Gadot. I always considered her to be an average actress at best, but this must be a career worst. Barring some real stinker performance coming along in the next months, they must already be engraving her Razzie as I type these words. Certainly there were more competent actresses that could infuse some life in this role, but Gadot's wooden cartoonish performance is atrocious, and even if Disney hired her on account of her fame alone, that plan certainly backfired as her acting is being heavily criticized and the box office projections don't seem promising. In the end, the movie is passable basically on Zegler's authentic performance and a bit of nostalgia for the original animated film. It's far from the disaster some were foreseeing, but is definitely a one-time watch which will come and go without leaving much of a mark.",5/10,amid sever controversi troubl product latest snow white adapt final verdict film quit averag controversi cast asid rachel zegler deliv fine perform basic carri movi shoulder unlik anoth thespian mention shortli girl actual act stori chang key part still fall short magic origin among jar decis creat dwarf use cgi resembl anim counterpart worst render uncanni valley appear could easili resolv hire seven actual littl peopl job aw aspect cast gal gadot alway consid averag actress best must career worst bar real stinker perform come along next month must alreadi engrav razzi type word certainli compet actress could infus life role gadot wooden cartoonish perform atroci even disney hire account fame alon plan certainli backfir act heavili critic box offic project seem promis end movi passabl basic zegler authent perform bit nostalgia origin anim film far disast forese definit watch come go without leav much mark,-0.5106,0.065,0.079,0.856,Negative

"Disney has decided to kill imagination by turning their beloved classics into soulless live-action remakes. Rachel Zegler they can never make me hate you. She has talent and charm, she can sing and she can belt. She's made for the stage but we're lucky we can watch her on the screen. Gal Gadot was a serious miscast, there is nothing of hers that feels in place here. She's hidden under this costume and she can't sing and still they gave her a lot to do. The whole movie suffers from a really badly written script. There are many ideas that they could have built more on, but sadly they chose to explore many, without really giving any of them the space to develope into something fresh or bold or beautiful. I didn't expect this to be a musical, most of the modern songs were really cringe worthy and felt like they don't belong in this world of ""Snow White"". The seven dwarfs honestly are an outrage, I really won't ever understand how this felt acceptable. Sadly there are many things that kill the joy in the movie, and the serious problem is the pacing and the plot that's all over the place. There are casting problems, and song problems, and fantasy problems and so ""Snow White"" will be shelved at the shelf of the really bad Disney remakes which lately has become really overcrowded.",4/10,disney decid kill imagin turn belov classic soulless remak rachel zegler never make hate talent charm sing belt made stage lucki watch screen gal gadot seriou miscast noth feel place hidden costum ca sing still gave lot whole movi suffer realli badli written script mani idea could built sadli chose explor mani without realli give space develop someth fresh bold beauti expect music modern song realli cring worthi felt like belong world snow white seven dwarf honestli outrag realli wo ever understand felt accept sadli mani thing kill joy movi seriou problem pace plot place cast problem song problem fantasi problem snow white shelv shelf realli bad disney remak late becom realli overcrowd,-0.9008,0.134,0.202,0.664,Negative

Disney has always been known for creating timeless stories and movies that generations have loved but this version of Snow White just feels wrong It doesn't honor the magic of the original, and the casting choice makes it even harder to connect with. Why fix something that was never broken?

"Disney's Snow White trailer promised, in capital letters: ""The classic story comes to life"". Nothing could be farther from the truth, as the more Disney makes these live action movies, the more they look like animated movies made by CGI. To the point that human actors feel almost out of place. It's as if the animation gene of the studio was too strong and it wanted to take over.

The other trend in Disney live action movies that is also visible in this Snow White is that they seem dominated by the guys making the cheap Disney Channel musicals, or the people making the Broadway shows. Highly choreographed musical numbers designed and filmed as if we were just sitting in a theatre, as opposed to with a film lens.

Beyond that, as live action Disney remakes go, Snow White is better than average without ever being great. To those criticizing the movie for steering too far from the original, it's probably worth reminding them that the original is a tale from 1812, and the 1937 Disney movie took plenty of liberties relative to that original already. So yes, it's okay for Snow White to be of latin descent, for Prince Charming not to be a prince, and so on. We expect filmmakers to adapt stories over time, and for whatever reason they want.

The issue with Disney remakes is actually that they don't evolve enough relative to the animated version. In that regard, Snow White tries harder than others. And the new scenes are where the movie seems to find its wings and is able to breathe. But it's weighed down by the requirements to reproduce entire scenes from the animated film. Long scenes where it's clear the filmmakers are checking boxes and don't have their hearts in it.",5/10,disney snow white trailer promis capit letter classic stori come life noth could farther truth disney make live action movi look like anim movi made cgi point human actor feel almost place anim gene studio strong want take trend disney live action movi also visibl snow white seem domin guy make cheap disney channel music peopl make broadway show highli choreograph music number design film sit theatr oppos film len beyond live action disney remak go snow white better averag without ever great critic movi steer far origin probabl worth remind origin tale disney movi took plenti liberti rel origin alreadi ye okay snow white latin descent princ charm princ expect filmmak adapt stori time whatev reason want issu disney remak actual evolv enough rel anim version regard snow white tri harder other new scene movi seem find wing abl breath weigh requir reproduc entir scene anim film long scene clear filmmak check box heart,0.9479,0.151,0.019,0.83,Positive

"I went to the theater with an open mind, trying my best to set aside the original story and avoid making comparisons. I just wanted to watch a movie, immerse myself in the story, and be entertained for two hours.

The result of my experience, still avoiding deeper analysis or comparisons, is that it's an okay movie. Nothing exceptional. The storyline is okay, the acting is okay (for a Disney princess movie), though there are some weak spots in the plot, as well as in the way certain moments of tension are developed and resolved. But I wouldn't call it terrible, far from it.

If I were to start making comparisons and analyzing the producers' choices (some of which I find downright ridiculous), my opinion would drop significantly. But I don't think it's fair to dislike, or hate, the movie for what I consider the wrong reasons.

"Snow White is definitely nothing groundbreaking or new. It is a rather dull and formulaic remake, which doesn't reach the heights of other Disney remakes of recent years. It is still a perfectly fun family film, which is generally well made. It is mainly let down by the poor performance by Gal Gadot as the evil Queen, as well as a jumbled and formulaic storyline whi h definitely drags towards the end.

The old songs are very charming, and the new ones are fairly memorable (if a little bit dull and formulaic). The stand outs in the film are Rachel Zegler as Snow White, and Jonathan, who provide fun and perfectly good performances. The romance between the two is a bit forced, as there is not a huge amount of chemistry.

The dwarves are also somewhat of a stand out in the film, especially dopey. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the CGI design of the characters, but they added a lighthertedness to the film, and were well voiced. I especially like the Hi-Ho sequence, but in general, the dwarves were quite forgettable.

"In summary: Audiovisual carries the film and it's definitely a decent family watch.

In detail: Despite the rewrites from the original Snow White story by Disney, this film still somehow pulls off a little touch of magic in its world. In this case, the two major things that uplift its quality are the music and CGI. The music really delivers its authentic feel with modern ensemble, performed beautifully by the casts. The CGI on the other hand, dwarves especially, really bring them out to life without leaving important resemblances of the classic.

Unfortunately, performance wise, Rachel Zegler (debatably) actually has it, theatrically. Definitely not for the look, character, and soul of Snow White. On Gal 's end, she has performed absolutely terribly, expressionless and unnaturally forced as usual (usual being her performance in other films). As for the other casts, they perform normally well.

"I watched this movie in the theatre today and the main reason I wanted to watch this was because of the horrible reviews for this movie.

I watched it and it wasn't as bad as people said. I think 1/2 stars is a bit harsh. Around 3-5ish would've been more realistic. Some of the acting was off and they dramatized the scenes more than needed. The songs were okay but that wasn't the main problem. The main problem was the plot of the story, i get that this is a remake but the plot was uhm.. questionable. And the things going on wasn't very necessary for the movie.

"I went to the theater with an open mind, trying my best to set aside the original story and avoid making comparisons (I am 46 years old). I just wanted to watch a movie, immerse myself in the story, and be entertained for two hours.

The result of my experience, still avoiding deeper analysis or comparisons, is that it's an okay movie. Nothing exceptional. The storyline is okay, the acting is okay (for a Disney princess movie), though there are some weak spots in the plot, as well as in the way certain moments of tension are developed and resolved.

But I wouldn't call it terrible, far from it.

If I were to start making comparisons and analyzing the producers' choices (some of which I find downright ridiculous), my opinion would drop significantly. But I really don't think it's fair to dislike (or hate) the movie for what I consider the wrong reasons.

This movie should be judged for what it is, on its own terms. And my honest take? It's an okay movie. Decent. Nothing remarkable, but far from awful.

"The 2025 Snow White film presents an intriguing storyline that successfully reimagines the classic fairy tale while incorporating a unique blend of animation and live-action, reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?. The visual style creates a fantastical world where animated elements seamlessly interact with human characters, giving the film a distinct and imaginative feel.

However, one notable aspect of the film is its heavy reliance on singing. While music plays a crucial role in many Disney adaptations, this version may feel overwhelming to viewers who prefer a more balanced approach to storytelling. The sheer amount of singing at times detracts from the narrative, making certain scenes feel drawn out rather than progressing the plot effectively.

Despite this, the film's resolution is satisfying and uplifting. The ending brings the kingdom's people together, emphasizing unity and the power of hope. The Evil Stepmother faces a fitting downfall, as she is ultimately banished, ensuring that peace is restored to the land. This resolution leaves the door open for further storytelling, making it a strong candidate for expansion into a television series, much like Once Upon a Time. With a rich world and well-developed characters, a series spin-off could explore deeper lore, side stories, and the continued adventures of Snow White and those around her.",5/10,snow white film present intrigu storylin success reimagin classic fairi tale incorpor uniqu blend anim reminisc frame roger rabbit visual style creat fantast world anim element seamlessli interact human charact give film distinct imagin feel howev one notabl aspect film heavi relianc sing music play crucial role mani disney adapt version may feel overwhelm viewer prefer balanc approach storytel sheer amount sing time detract narr make certain scene feel drawn rather progress plot effect despit film resolut satisfi uplift end bring kingdom peopl togeth emphas uniti power hope evil stepmoth face fit downfal ultim banish ensur peac restor land resolut leaf door open storytel make strong candid expans televis seri much like upon time rich world charact seri could explor deeper lore side stori continu adventur snow white around,0.9413,0.17,0.059,0.771,Positive

"The film intended to adapt Snow White to more contemporary times, and it wasn't easy given that the animated film tells the story in a traditional way. There was no way to recreate it that would change this because the traditional style used is part of the animated film's identity. The choice was to be a loose adaptation of the Brothers Grimm tale, using elements from the animated film. The film has identifiable elements from the animated version, but a more distinct story that doesn't depend on the animated film. It's a much more independent story, but it maintains some very important aspects of the original tale.

Rachel stumbles at times, but her acting and singing are admirable. Because Snow White's name has always been linked to the character's appearance, redesigning the character wasn't going to be easy. Throughout the adaptations, the character has been fairly respected, with actresses who sometimes conformed to Snow White's beauty standard. Likewise, redesigning Snow White wasn't impossible, either her name or the meaning of her given name could have been changed. Here, they did the latter by linking Snow White's name to the time of her birth during the snowy season. In the 1997 adaptation, Snow White decided to summon courage and confront her stepmother. It was here that Snow White would evolve in subsequent adaptations, becoming a more heroic girl. In ""Mirror Mirror"" and ""Snow White & The Huntsman,"" we see this princess becoming a warrior to confront the queen and free her kingdom from tyranny. This 2024 adaptation follows the same formula, and unlike what audiences have said, here Snow White is driven by honor and concern for her people, just like in the adaptations exemplified above.

Something that has always been essential to the character's core is kindness and gentleness. This has been present in many of the different versions of Snow White, and her pure heart is what has always characterized her. This is also present in this film because Snow White cares for her people and the people around her. Here, Snow White resorts to more stoicism and is a force that acts more through the spirit than the body itself. Beyond giving new meaning to the name, the film does the same with the concept of beauty. When the mirror says that Snow White is the fairest, it doesn't refer to her look, but to the purity of her heart.

Gal Gadot plays Queen Grimhilde, who is serious most of the time and sometimes overacts, but maintains the character's characteristic jealousy and coldness. It may have left something to be desired, but it's a version that, in terms of design and personality, closely resembles the image Grimhilde has had since Disney's animated version. Although the film doesn't explicitly show it, it's easy to see that Grimhilde is overly obsessed with being the only beautiful woman in the entire kingdom. Something that has been present in many adaptations.

The seven dwarfs were redesigned as gnomes, partially respecting the look and personality of their animated counterparts. The downside is that the CGI gave them a somewhat bizarre appearance that could have been corrected with better rendering. Here, the prince was reimagined as a Robin Hood-style bandit named Jonathan. Although he is a somewhat careless man, he plays a role as Snow White's companion and future lover. Jonathan is a noble man who believes in justice and a rebel with ideas that are very compatible with Snow White's. The two make a good duo and have a chemistry that makes love blossom between them.

After all this, it's a very well-functioning adaptation and a stunning fantasy film. Regardless, the animated film remained difficult to dethrone, but this version of Snow White is a good and satisfying film. My final rating for this film is 9/10.",9/10,film intend adapt snow white contemporari time easi given anim film tell stori tradit way way recreat would chang tradit style use part anim film ident choic loos adapt brother grimm tale use element anim film film identifi element anim version distinct stori depend anim film much independ stori maintain import aspect origin tale rachel stumbl time act sing admir snow white name alway link charact appear redesign charact go easi throughout adapt charact fairli respect actress sometim conform snow white beauti standard likewis redesign snow white imposs either name mean given name could chang latter link snow white name time birth snowi season adapt snow white decid summon courag confront stepmoth snow white would evolv subsequ adapt becom heroic girl mirror mirror snow white huntsman see princess becom warrior confront queen free kingdom tyranni adapt follow formula unlik audienc said snow white driven honor concern peopl like adapt exemplifi someth alway essenti charact core kind gentl present mani differ version snow white pure heart alway character also present film snow white care peopl peopl around snow white resort stoicism forc act spirit bodi beyond give new mean name film concept beauti mirror say snow white fairest refer look puriti heart gal gadot play queen grimhild seriou time sometim overact maintain charact characterist jealousi cold may left someth desir version term design person close resembl imag grimhild sinc disney anim version although film explicitli show easi see grimhild overli obsess beauti woman entir kingdom someth present mani adapt seven dwarf redesign gnome partial respect look person anim counterpart downsid cgi gave somewhat bizarr appear could correct better render princ reimagin robin bandit name jonathan although somewhat careless man play role snow white companion futur lover jonathan nobl man belief justic rebel idea compat snow white two make good duo chemistri make love blossom adapt stun fantasi film regardless anim film remain difficult dethron version snow white good satisfi film final rate film,0.9898,0.135,0.032,0.833,Positive

"The new Snow White movie is a delightful watch that brings a fresh twist to the classic fairy tale, making it a perfect choice for kids. The vibrant visuals, catchy songs, and heartwarming storyline are sure to keep young audiences entertained from start to finish. It's a movie that beautifully blends nostalgia with modern elements, giving both children and adults something to enjoy.

What I don't quite understand is why so many people seem to dislike it. It's clear that the filmmakers aimed to create a fun, family-friendly experience, and that's exactly what they delivered. Sure, there are changes to the original story, but that's part of the magic of reimagining classic tales - it makes them more relatable and engaging for today's audience. It's a movie meant to be light-hearted and enjoyable, so why nitpick every little detail?

People these days seem to find fault with everything, no matter how well it's made. Sometimes, we just need to let ourselves enjoy the ride, especially when it's meant for kids.

Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, delivers a powerful performance, adding layers of complexity to the iconic villain.

"My roommates and I went and saw this movie expecting the worst and were prepared to walk out if it was terrible. We were pleasantly surprised by how well Disney adapted the original Snow White while also adding the smallest twist to appeal more to younger audiences. The plot of the movie follows the original pretty closely with a couple of extra scenes added to develop Snow White and other characters. There were no major deviances from the original movie, except of the Evil Queen's death.

The musical numbers were gas, fire, flames. Genuinely the best part of the movie was anytime someone sang, which was the majority of the movie. Snow White's dress was stunning, and the Evil Queen's design was also well done. The only horrible outfit was the main guy's, but it wasn't super distracting. He was charming and convincing as Snow's love interest. Gal Gadot also did great as the Evil Queen, her performance was dramatic like a classic Disney villain and scared me just as much as the original. The color grading and cinematography were also pretty good. It did not look dull or lifeless like the Little Mermaid did.

The only major cons of this movie are the seven dwarves and the pacing. Every time the dwarves were on screen it was jarring, but despite that I still found myself emotionally connecting with these characters. There was also an issue with how jarring some of the transitions were between scenes and the shift in tone. Some parts of the plot were not fully explained/developed. I think a majority of the critics of this movie are forgetting that it is meant for kids, and are upset that it is not a carbon copy of the original.

While the movie is not perfect, I would recommend seeing this movie if you like musicals or have kids. Just don't expect it to be as good as the original if Snow White is one of your favorites.",8/10,roommat went saw movi expect worst prepar walk terribl pleasantli surpris well disney adapt origin snow white also ad smallest twist appeal younger audienc plot movi follow origin pretti close coupl extra scene ad develop snow white charact major devianc origin movi except evil queen death music number ga fire flame genuin best part movi anytim someon sang major movi snow white dress stun evil queen design also well done horribl outfit main guy super distract charm convinc snow love interest gal gadot also great evil queen perform dramat like classic disney villain scare much origin color grade cinematographi also pretti good look dull lifeless like littl mermaid major con movi seven dwarf pace everi time dwarf screen jar despit still found emot connect charact also issu jar transit scene shift tone part plot fulli think major critic movi forget meant kid upset carbon copi origin movi perfect would recommend see movi like music kid expect good origin snow white one favorit,0.4939,0.212,0.189,0.599,Positive

"Sometimes the fairest of them all is the one that challenges your comfort zone.

I have never gone to see a film purely because of how much backlash it was receiving, but-well-there is a first time for everything. The controversy around Disney's live-action Snow White intrigued me. The outrage, the think pieces, the online vitriol-it all made me wonder what, exactly, people were so furious about.

So I went in with no expectations. No nostalgia bias. No need to defend the original. And I was absolutely blown away.

Let me say this plainly: there is nothing wrong with this film. Nothing. If its message-of strength, compassion, justice, and self-determination-bothers you, then the problem is not with Snow White. The problem is you.

Imagine being upset about a story where a young woman rises to face evil, saves her kingdom, refuses to be passive, finds love without surrendering her independence, and dares to do what is right even when it is dangerous. That is the story this film tells, and it tells it with heart, humor, and visual beauty.

The performances are vibrant, the sets and costumes are lush and imaginative, and the direction is sure-handed. There is joy in this film. A sense of play. A deliberate balance between honoring the classic tale and reinterpreting it for a generation that sees the world through a more inclusive and complex lens.

Were there things that could have been done differently? Certainly. No film is perfect. But the core of this one-its spirit, its message, its visual and emotional execution-is solid. More than solid. It is delightful.

Would I take children to see this? Absolutely. Not only would I take them, I would encourage them to watch the original animated Snow White first and then experience this new version. Let them see how stories evolve over time. Let them see that heroines can grow stronger, villains more nuanced, and messages more resonant.

And if it bothers you that Snow White is not the same as she was in 1937... well, I do not know what to tell you.

"Snowwhite is a breathtaking reinterpretation of the classic tale, blending stunning visuals, strong performances, and an engaging narrative. From the very first scene, the film immerses you in a beautifully crafted world, with cinematography that feels both grand and intimate.

"5 year olds are not the target audience -

This is a live action remake, with a plot and animation style which are not intended for young children.

It's child-friendly, and children can enjoy the colors/the singing, but by no means were children thought of as the primary target audience of this film..

The casting (while certainly diverse), is not hurt by the casting of Rachel Zegler, nor Gal Godot.

Disney would be far better off making a much darker film (for adults), than they were here (straddling the line between a film for adults and a film for all ages).

These live-actions are not popular with young children, yet they are not dark enough for the adult audience which grew up with these films and who actually wants to see the films.

Children have a 5-20 minute attention span and generally appear to care more about the colors and cartoon/animation... Yet, Snow-White a long with The Lion King (amongst others) lack a meaningful story to keep the adults entertained.

Either go back to fully animated films, or make these films for a PG-13 audience (since children are not watching more than a few minutes of any of these live-action remakes).",10/10,year old target audienc live action remak plot anim style intend young child child enjoy sing mean child thought primari target audienc film cast certainli divers hurt cast rachel zegler gal godot disney would far better make much darker film adult straddl line film adult film age popular young child yet dark enough adult audienc grew film actual want see film child minut attent span gener appear care color yet long lion king amongst other lack meaning stori keep adult entertain either go back fulli anim film make film audienc sinc child watch minut remak,0.8402,0.145,0.053,0.803,Positive

"I suspect that MANY of these reviews are written out of pure spite by people who haven't seen the movie. The first review I read criticized Snow White's hair, when the reason why it looks so bad was made obvious early in the movie. For all of the clueless haters out there, it was intentional. You don't deserve more than that.

I saw it yesterday and absolutely loved it!

In contrast, the original movie is now very archaic, both in style and in the storytelling. Personally, the original Snow White's voice really grates on my nerves. She reminds me of some sort of Betty Boop character. In the original version, Snow White is basically a victim, who is rescued by her ""true love,"" with whom she has not even had a simple conversation. To be blunt, she is not much of a role model.

This interpretation, building upon the original structure, is much more complex, full of depth, and Snow White is a much stronger lead now, as is her love interest, Jonathan. They are both taking an active role in pushing back against the evil queen to restore their once-happy kingdom. Rachel (such a beautiful voice) and Andrew were relatable and made for a great couple. Gal Gadot did a great job as the very, very evil stepmother/queen. And I loved the expanded role of the dwarfs, especially Dopey, of course!

I thought the visuals were beautiful, and enjoyed most of the music. I was already a big fan of composers Pasek and Paul (The Greatest Showman, Smash, La La Land, 2019 live action Aladdin).

I believe that this updated version will be much more appealing to kids (especially little girls). I hope that they will take to heart the four words on Snow White's heart pendant: ""Fearless, Fair, Brave, True."" And for adults who are feeling nostalgic for Disney fairytales, I hope that this movie brings you some joy!",9/10,suspect mani review written pure spite peopl seen movi first review read critic snow white hair reason look bad made obviou earli movi clueless hater intent deserv saw yesterday absolut love contrast origin movi archaic style storytel person origin snow white voic realli grate nerv remind sort betti boop charact origin version snow white basic victim rescu true love even simpl convers blunt much role model interpret build upon origin structur much complex full depth snow white much stronger lead love interest jonathan take activ role push back evil queen restor kingdom rachel beauti voic andrew relat made great coupl gal gadot great job evil love expand role dwarf especi dopey cours thought visual beauti enjoy music alreadi big fan compos pasek paul greatest showman smash la la land live action aladdin believ updat version much appeal kid especi littl girl hope take heart four word snow white heart pendant fearless fair brave true adult feel nostalg disney fairytal hope movi bring joy,0.9906,0.291,0.12,0.588,Positive

The animals had a friendly cartoony look that really worked, Rachel Zegler and Andrew Burnap had amazing chemistry and it was adorable.

"I absolutely loved the movie! They finally brought back the magic of colors, making every scene visually stunning and vibrant. The songs are incredibly captivating, adding an extra layer of charm and emotion to the story. Of course, like any movie, it has a few flaws, but that's completely normal and doesn't take away from the overall experience. The film does a fantastic job of retelling the story in a fresh, engaging, and entertaining way. It's the perfect introduction for a new generation.

"It's not a ten but apparently this movie is vein rated all sorts of crazy things, so I'll join that trend.

Rachel Zegler is amazing, wonderful singer, and adds this beautiful classical Disney princess animation to her acting - if you see the film, you know what I mean.

The movie has some great new original songs, that are propper bobs.

The movie has all the original story points, and just expands on this - which I think is what the remakes should do! Be nostalgic but also bring something new to the party.

Gal Gadot was miscast - this part could have been so fun with the right actress. I think issue is Gal Gadot can't get the evilness across without beeing cartoonish sit in leather chair and pet a cat kind of way. But when she has to be big and campy, it like she's worried about looking silly and then by default falls a bit flat.

"The movie was nothing short of breathtaking-a visually stunning and emotionally rich tribute to the classic. Every element, from the cinematography to the performances, captured the magic and wonder that made the original so beloved. The music, in particular, was a highlight, with each song feeling as though it belonged on a grand Broadway stage, elevating the film's charm and emotional depth.

Yet, despite its brilliance, some continue to insist, ""Don't touch the classics,"" as if adaptations somehow diminish the legacy of the original. Ironically, many seem to forget that Snow White itself was never a Disney invention but rather an adaptation of the timeless tale by the Brothers Grimm. Stories evolve, just as they always have, finding new ways to resonate with different generations. Dismissing reinterpretations simply because they dare to reimagine a beloved story is shortsighted and ignores the very nature of storytelling.

At its core, this film is not a replacement but a heartfelt homage-a love letter to the classic that respects its origins while breathing fresh life into it. It reminds us that the beauty of stories lies not just in preserving them but in allowing them to grow, ensuring they continue to inspire for years to come.",10/10,movi noth short visual stun emot rich tribut classic everi element cinematographi perform captur magic wonder made origin belov music particular highlight song feel though belong grand broadway stage elev film charm emot depth yet despit brillianc continu insist touch classic adapt somehow diminish legaci origin iron mani seem forget snow white never disney invent rather adapt timeless tale brother grimm stori evolv alway find new way reson differ gener dismiss reinterpret simpli dare reimagin belov stori shortsight ignor natur storytel core film replac heartfelt love letter classic respect origin breath fresh life remind u beauti stori lie preserv allow grow ensur continu inspir year come,0.9744,0.216,0.015,0.769,Positive

Well we enjoyed it. I think to understand the story you need to read the villians book set where it has the book Fairest of them all. Because there is more to the original story.

"Disney's 2025 live-action reimagining of ""Snow White"" has arrived, and while it attempts to modernize the classic fairy tale, it ultimately stumbles, leaving audiences with a mixed bag of disappointment and fleeting moments of charm. Directed by Marc Webb, the film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, promising a fresh perspective on the beloved story. However, several missteps prevent it from achieving true ""amazing"" status.

One of the most significant issues lies in the film's script. The dialogue often feels clunky and unnatural, lacking the whimsical charm of the original. Key plot points are altered, but these changes don't necessarily enhance the story, sometimes even detracting from its emotional core. The seven dwarfs, a crucial element of the original, are reimagined with CGI that falls into the uncanny valley, proving more distracting than endearing.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is a highlight. She brings a refreshing sincerity and strength to the character, portraying her as more proactive and less passive than in the animated version. Her vocal talents are undeniable, and she delivers the new songs with passion but Disney could have hired another actor who's white as snow because in the animated movie the magic mirror describes snow white's skin as ""white as snow"".

Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is another bright spot. She infuses the character with a captivating blend of vanity and menace, making her a compelling antagonist. Her performance hints at the potential the film had, but it's ultimately overshadowed by the weaker aspects of the production.

Visually, ""Snow White"" is a mixed bag. While some scenes capture the fairytale atmosphere, others suffer from cheap-looking CGI and uninspired set design.

The film's attempts to modernize the story also fall flat. While updating certain aspects for contemporary audiences is understandable, ""Snow White"" seems unsure of its target audience, resulting in a film that doesn't fully satisfy either nostalgic fans of the original or those seeking a fresh, modern take.

But overall the film is really good! I didn't like where the seven dwarfs were CGI and they could've replaced them with real actors with dwarfism. But other than that it's honestly quite spectacular.",10/10,disney reimagin snow white arriv attempt modern classic fairi tale ultim stumbl leav audienc mix bag disappoint fleet moment charm direct marc webb film star rachel zegler snow white gal gadot evil queen promis fresh perspect belov stori howev sever misstep prevent achiev true amaz statu one signific issu lie film script dialogu often feel clunki unnatur lack whimsic charm origin key plot point alter chang necessarili enhanc stori sometim even detract emot core seven dwarf crucial element origin reimagin cgi fall uncanni valley prove distract endear rachel zegler perform snow white highlight bring refresh sincer strength charact portray proactiv less passiv anim version vocal talent undeni deliv new song passion disney could hire anoth actor white snow anim movi magic mirror describ snow white skin white snow gal gadot portray evil queen anoth bright spot infus charact captiv blend vaniti menac make compel antagonist perform hint potenti film ultim overshadow weaker aspect product visual snow white mix bag scene captur fairytal atmospher other suffer cgi uninspir set design film attempt modern stori also fall flat updat certain aspect contemporari audienc understand snow white seem unsur target audienc result film fulli satisfi either nostalg fan origin seek fresh modern take overal film realli good like seven dwarf cgi could replac real actor dwarfism honestli quit spectacular,0.8271,0.148,0.099,0.753,Positive
Honestly worth the watch. Despite changes for a modern audience Snow White still tells an authentic story that stays true to the animated original. Adding more to the story in a just way. Such as the back story for the live interest that isn't really in the original animated and while fantastical and disneyfied brings out that disney magic that is true to these fairytale stories. Gripping you from the start with some outstanding songs that stick with you. Would pay to see again and again. Doesn't quite take the top spot for me but it's almost the best so far.

"Took my children to this new rendition of Snow White and as a whole we absolutely loved it. The settings made the movie feel cozy and familiar, but the empowerment of Snow White made the movie refreshing and new! Rachel's voice is insanely beautiful and Gal did her best to keep up with that kind musical talent, and it was okay. Loved every minute and so did my kids! I know people are upset with the Snow White being ""white"" but the movie explains how she got her name. No it's not the same as the original but at the end of the day it's a reimagining of the original. It's okay for there to be deviation from the original. The Harry Potter movies don't follow the books exactly, but it didn't make the movies any less great!

It also has some of the best Disney songs since Encanto and captures the classical Disney magic. My only critique would be the evil queens singing at times is too nasily and her belt could use improvement to sound healthier but all of the character performances were outstanding.

The attention to detail and the artistry in the film were remarkable. You can tell that a lot of love and effort went into making this movie. My daughter was captivated by the characters, especially Snow White and the adorable dwarfs. We found ourselves singing along to the songs and sharing laughs throughout.

"I never thought I'd say this-but Snow White has become one of my favorite princesses.

Growing up, the 1937 classic never really spoke to me. Snow White felt passive, distant-more a symbol than a character. Aside from the Once Upon a Time TV show version, she had always been my least favorite princess.

But Disney's 2025 Snow White changed everything.

This reimagining gave us the heroine we always needed: fearless, fair, brave, and true. She's no longer just waiting to be rescued-she leads with heart, makes bold choices, and shines with purpose. I saw myself in her strength, her flaws, her hope. It was powerful.

The film is pure magic. The music? Absolutely sing-along worthy-I've had the soundtrack on loop since I left the theater. It captures the spirit of a fairy tale while feeling completely fresh. The tone reminded me of Enchanted, The Princess Bride, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Tangled, and Ella Enchanted-clever, heartfelt, and fun, with just the right dose of whimsy.

Without giving anything away, I'll just say the story moved me in ways I didn't expect. I laughed, teared up, and left the theater feeling lighter, like I'd just witnessed something special.

This isn't just a remake. It's a reinvention. And now, Snow White isn't just fair-she's fearless, brave, and true too. I can't wait to watch it again.",10/10,never thought say snow white becom one favorit princess grow classic never realli spoke snow white felt passiv symbol charact asid upon time tv show version alway least favorit princess disney snow white chang everyth reimagin gave u heroin alway need fearless fair brave true longer wait lead heart make bold choic shine purpos saw strength flaw hope power film pure magic music absolut soundtrack loop sinc left theater captur spirit fairi tale feel complet fresh tone remind enchant princess bride robin hood men tight tangl ella heartfelt fun right dose whimsi without give anyth away say stori move way expect laugh tear left theater feel lighter like wit someth special remak reinvent snow white fearless brave true ca wait watch,0.9915,0.317,0.021,0.662,Positive
"I went to see Snow White with my 7-year-old, and we both absolutely loved it. From start to finish, it was a magical experience. The songs were incredibly catchy-we caught ourselves humming a few of them on the way home-and they added a lot of charm and energy to the story. The production was stunning, with beautiful costumes, sets, and visuals that really brought the fairy tale world to life.

What stood out most for me as a parent was how well the film balanced its tone. It had just the right mix of light suspense and gentle humor, without being too intense or frightening for younger kids. There were a few moments of tension, but nothing that felt overwhelming or too dark. My child was fully engaged throughout, laughing at the funny parts and wide-eyed during the magical moments.

Overall, it was a wonderfully age-appropriate film with a classic fairy tale feel and a heartwarming message. A great choice for a family movie outing, especially with younger children.",10/10,went see snow white absolut love start finish magic experi song incred caught hum way ad lot charm energi stori product stun beauti costum set visual realli brought fairi tale world life stood parent well film balanc tone right mix light suspens gentl humor without intens frighten younger kid moment tension noth felt overwhelm dark child fulli engag throughout laugh funni part magic moment overal wonder film classic fairi tale feel heartwarm messag great choic famili movi outing especi younger child,0.9504,0.215,0.041,0.744,Positive

"I was honestly scared to go see this movie. There has been so much negative talk around it.

I didn't know what to expect, but I thought this movie was amazing.

The original Snow White was a little scary and creepy watching it as a kid, and they definitely kept this feeling in the live action.

They also paid tribute to the original movie many times and it did not disappoint.

My kids, friends and I could not stop laughing. Whether it was intentional or because the movie was truly cringe (in a good way) like all of the Disney cartoon princess movies.. we had a great time watching this movie.

As a true Disney fan of the original Snow White movie, this was a 10 out of 10.

"Snow White has that pure Disney magic, thanks to some incredible new music and a fantastic lead performance from Rachel Zegler! Waiting on a Wish was worth the price of admission alone! I had a smile on my face the whole time, it made the Disney adult in me very happy and worked very well as an adaptation of the original 1937 animated film. As someone who never really loved the original besides the appreciation of the history and the art behind it, I was way more into this version of the story! Not only that but unlike some other Disney live-action adaptations, this was a true adaptation of the story rather than pure nostalgic mimicry like The Lion King was! I liked the moments and songs that they kept, and I liked the changes they made! While not every choice in the movie works, director Marc Webb did a solid job bringing this fairytale to life with only a few missteps here and there. It can be clunky, and moments didn't always feel earned by the film especially when it came to emotion, but it still had that magical Disney feel to it. And it boasts some of the best new Disney music in years! Waiting on a Wish is spectacular, Good Things Grow is a perfect opening, Princess Problems is so fun, and A Hand Meets a Hand is gorgeous. The extensions/reworking of some of the classic songs like Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work were fantastic too and I was so happy to see those sequences come to life - it made me feel the same way I do when I go to Disneyland! The music was my favourite part for sure - songwriters Pasek and Paul did a fantastic job here! Another pro: Rachel Zegler was born to play a Disney princess! She is a naturally gifted performer, and she enchants as Snow White with her stunning singing voice and inherent charm. She is a star and one of the best parts and main reasons to see the film! Gal Gadot, on the other hand, is horribly miscast and one of the worst parts of the film, delivering a performance full of horrid line readings. I've come to expect little from these Disney remakes, but Snow White ended up being genuinely great! It's flawed, but it's one of the better remakes and I loved the changes they made while honouring what we love about the original - it is worth a watch for Disney fans!
